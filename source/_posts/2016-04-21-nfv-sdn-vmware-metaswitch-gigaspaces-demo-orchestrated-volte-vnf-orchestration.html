<p>Metaswitch and GigaSpaces showed a fully orchestrated VoLTE solution on the VMware stand at Mobile World Congress last month that exemplified what agility can really mean for network operators deploying NFV. In case you missed the demo, the highlights and significance&nbsp;are discussed in a recent <a href="http://www.telecomtv.com/articles/vmware/gigaspaces-and-metaswitch-discuss-the-fully-orchestrated-volte-solution-shown-at-the-vmware-booth-mwc-2016-13407/">VMware interview posted on TelecomTV.</a></p>

<p>The demo showed Metaswitch <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2015/03/22/mobile-world-congress-nfv-sdn-network-orchestration-automation.html" Target="_blank">virtual network functions</a> (VNFs) Clearwater and Perimeta running on the VMware cloud environment – specifically, VMware Integrated OpenStack and vCloud Director – and employing the <a href="http://getcloudify.org/nfv">Cloudify NFV orchestrator</a> from GigaSpaces.</p>

<p>In the TelecomTV interview, Uri Cohen, GigaSpaces executive VP of Cloudify product and marketing, explained that the VoLTE services were actually set up and working literally in minutes, as opposed to taking weeks or months if physical hardware was deployed.</p>

<p>Metaswitch SVP of engineering Al Mitchell said that the customer response to the demo was fantastic. “We’re demonstrating a working, functional, orchestrated solution for VoLTE. People have been amazed to see what previously was just being talked about now actually working in a real and deployable way.”</p>
