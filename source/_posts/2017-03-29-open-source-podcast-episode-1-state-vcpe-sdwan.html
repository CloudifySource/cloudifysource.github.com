  <p>We're really excited to bring you our new and improved <a href="http://theopensourcepodcast.com" target="_blank">Open Source Podcast</a>! This is our new iteration of the previous OpenStack & Beyond Podcast, where we focused mostly on OpenStack and the various work surrounding that community. We've realized that there are many more topics we want to cover above and beyond <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/openstack-architecture-cloudify.html" target="_blank">OpenStack</a>, so we expanded our coverage to cover almost any open source topic. Our main focus points on this podcast are along the lines of open source <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/nfv" target="_blank">NFV</a> and network automation, devops, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/container-docker-kubernetes-orchestration-management-cloud-deployment-automation.html" target="_blank">container</a> and cloud-native, and other related topics. As always, our team is on the ground at various events getting interviews from the floor at conferences like OpenStack Summit, VMworld, OSCON, Open Networking Summit, NFV World Congress, and others.</p>

  <h2>The Discussion</h2>
  <p>The podcast starts out discussing centralized versus distributed vCPE and SD-WAN. Centralized being where you bring all of your functions into the cloud and the edge of the network become simple, meaningless devices that connect the user or branch back into the cloud. A distributed vCPE model is where you virtualize the functions, but keep them at the edge of the network and running on them on commodity hardware. We then continue the conversation discussing the vCPE business model and market, and how open standards have had an effect on influencing how the decisions for vCPE/SD-WAN are made. Vanessa and Mark talk about what enterprises are focused on in this business versus what the service providers are looking to do, namely sell this service to the enterprises. Is it about cost savings, adding services, or something else?</p>

  <p>Just have a listen and hear what the experts are saying about vCPE and SD-WAN!</p><br>
