We are proud sponsors of ONS this year and we are excited to be displaying more of Cloudify's <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/network-function-virtualization-vnf-nfv-orchestration-sdn-platform.html" target="_blank">NFV orchestration</a> prowess to the NFV & SDN world.</p>

  <p>Our theme for this event is Pure-Play, Open Source, Open Standards, Multi-VIM NFV Orchestration. Coudify has definitely proven its capabilites already at MWC with our demos in collaboration with Metaswitch and Intel. We will be showing this and more and at the upcoming event at our booth SU14.</p>
