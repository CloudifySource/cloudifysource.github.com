  <p>We set out to ambitiously broadcast live from the <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2015/05/21/openstack-podcast-nfv-docker-network-orchestration-vmware-virtualization-summit-vancouver.html">OpenStack Summit</a> again, and despite having wifi troubles (hence the shaky start), and no real viable quiet place to sit - we went for it nonetheless, and came out with an excellent (albeit somewhat noisy) show joined by the very awesome panel of OpenStack aficionados including <a href="https://nz.linkedin.com/in/benkepes">Ben Kepes</a> (Analyst), <a href="https://at.linkedin.com/in/fghaas">Florian Haas</a> (Hastexo), and <a href="https://it.linkedin.com/in/fpercoco">Flavio Percoco</a> (Red Hat), and hosted by our own <a href="https://il.linkedin.com/in/arthurberezin">Arthur Berezin</a> and I (<a href="https://il.linkedin.com/in/sharonez">Sharone Zitzman</a>).</p>

  <p>This episode focuses on the news and headlines that came out of the event, as well as our panel’s take on what’s interesting...and what’s less so as well.</p>

  <p>The intrigue begins when staunch <a href="http://getcloudify.org/openstack-architecture-cloudify.html">OpenStack </a>evangelist Florian encounters Ben’s kiwi bluntness and at times less supportive OpenStack stance, and Flavio’s real-world take from down in the developer trenches.</p>

  <p>Some fun sound bites from the show:</p>

  <div class="testimonial">
  <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>  It’s been really exciting to see a lot of the projects begin to merge, like <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2015/05/18/openstack-neutron-nova-cloud-vm-networking-network-automation-orchestration.html" target="_blank">Neutron</a> for example that is starting to see some of its problems fixed...I think this is a big win for the community from a governance perspective, and a development perspective.  <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></p>

  <div class="testimonial">
  <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>  It’s been difficult getting to as many sessions as I would have liked to have gone to...especially having more of my talks accepted than expected.  <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></p> 
  <br/><strong>Florian Haas</strong>
  </div>

  <br/>

  <div class="testimonial">
  <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>  There’s a general sense that the overall community is becoming more mature, and focusing less on the new features, rather stabilizing features that are already in place and making sure they’re production-ready.  <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></p>

      <div class="testimonial">
  <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i><a href="http://getcloudify.org/docker-orchestration-docker-container-deployment-cloud.html" target="_blank">  Containers</a> are the new cool so everyone is jumping on that...for the right reasons or the wrong reasons.  <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></p>
  <br/><strong>Ben Kepes</strong>
  </div>

  <br/>

  <div class="testimonial">
  <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>  We’re finally establishing our best practices, we’re agreeing on how we want to do things, and we're streamlined implementations of those across vendors, and I think that’s very encouraging.  <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></p>
