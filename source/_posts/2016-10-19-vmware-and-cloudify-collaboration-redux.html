<p>Last week <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161012005061/en/VMware-GigaSpaces-Collaborate-Drive-Open-Network-Functions">Cloudify/GigaSpaces announced with VMware</a> a partnership to advance open orchestration for NFV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a small snippet from the announcement:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;...Cloudify with vCloud NFV can enable carriers to leverage VMware infrastructure assets and skillsets, with open source TOSCA-based orchestration from GigaSpaces. Cloudify with vCloud NFV users can deploy virtual network functions (VNFs) over hybrid cloud architectures, achieving automated lifecycle management of critical network functions and services. Customers can correlate information gathered through the VMware infrastructure with application requirements gathered through Cloudify to help deliver the best performance and utilization of the underlying resources. GigaSpaces will be developing a VMware vRealize Operations Management Pack&trade; that will enable infrastructure, event correlation, event notification and response, and policy management, enabling closed loop service remediation, proactive capacity planning and scaling.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In this post, I will provide a deeper look into what&rsquo;s really standing behind this partnership. But first, I&rsquo;ll start with where it all began.</p>

<h2>How it all started - a recap</h2>
<p>Those who know me, and know the Cloudify project, engage with us frequently through the <a href="http://getcloudify.org/openstack-architecture-cloudify.html">OpenStack</a> and <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2016/05/12/making-tosca-truly-portable-openstack-cloud-nfv-open-source-orchestration.html">TOSCA</a> communities.</p>
<p>A big part of our work with both of these communities set the stage for the beginning of our relationship with <a href="http://getcloudify.org/vmware-hybrid-cloud.html">VMware</a>, which started with the <a href="http://www.gigaspaces.com/gigaspaces-works-vmware-deliver-pilot-blueprinting-service-vcloud-air">vCloud Air team</a> as a result of a VMware decision to adopt a standard orchestration language, TOSCA, as part of its cloud strategy. Our first partnership engagement was intended to offer an <a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vcloud/2015/06/tosca-blueprints-vcloud-air.html">open standard blueprinting service</a> (similar to AWS CloudFormation) for vCloud Air. It was through that initial experience that we came to learn about, know and appreciate VMware as a product, and as a company.</p>
<p>As karma would have it, around that same time VMware launched a new NFV group focused on delivering cutting edge solutions for operators. This team quickly realized that the work that we&rsquo;d done to integrate TOSCA into vCloud Air could be even more beneficial for NFV. This was more or less obvious due to the fact that TOSCA and open orchestration had already started to emerge as high-priority requirements in many NFV projects. In this way, VMware&rsquo;s new product offering <a href="http://www.vmware.com/solutions/industry/telco.html">vCloud NFV</a> benefited from the joint integration and innovation work, and Cloudify continues to be the most commonly utilized Orchestrator with the vCloud NFV suite.</p>
<p>With VMware, we quickly started partnering in three main areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Advancing the open TOSCA orchestration solution for NFV</li>
<li>Integrating Cloudify TOSCA orchestration with the VMware vCloud NFV infrastructure (The integration included also support between vSphere and VIO stacks)</li>
<li>Enabling integration between TOSCA as a service modeling language and YANG as a data modeling language</li>
</ul>

<h2>How is our relationship with VMware different than others?</h2>
<p>One of the common question that I get whenever the partnership with VMware is brought up is, &ldquo;How is the relationship with VMware different than with other partners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well I must admit that at first it took me a while to really put my finger on it.</p>
<p>The main &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litmus#Uses">litmus test</a>&rdquo; of any relationship is how long it lasts. The dynamic is such that &ldquo;arm&rsquo;s length&rdquo; type of relationship may draw a nice spike at the time of announcement, but if there isn&rsquo;t real substance behind it and a strong business alignment, those types of relationships simply evaporate. A good example for that is <a href="http://siliconangle.com/blog/2011/09/01/vmforce-is-dead-the-platform-rivalry-heats-up-between-salesforce-com-and-vmware/">VMforce</a>.</p>
<p>For a partnership to last there needs to be strong business alignment and some real substance behind it at the product-level as well as joint customer demand. Our relationship with VMware is nearly two years old now. This is a strong indicator that it&rsquo;s more than an &ldquo;arm length&rdquo; type of relationship. Let me explain.</p>

<h2>VMware &amp; GigaSpaces/Cloudify Business Alignment</h2>
<p>By business alignment I&rsquo;m referring to the extent that the type of customers and the value that we sell to those customers is aligned or in conflict with one another. From a Cloudify perspective, I mapped three of core business values that drive both organizations and are representative of this synergy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hybrid cloud strategy - Both VMware and Cloudify take a hybrid cloud approach as a centerpiece in our product and GTM strategies, which is a testimony to our commitment to interoperability, and the inherent benefits that TOSCA makes possible</li>
<li>Cloud/Enterprise approach to NFV - Both VMware and Cloudify believe that the right approach to NFV is to bring the best practices from both Enterprise Cloud and Cloud Native worlds to NFV, and not try and bring the traditional network-centric approach to NFV, as many of the existing NFV players try to do.</li>
<li>Open standard and open infrastructure - As mentioned above, the relationship with VMware is based on shared interest in TOSCA as a standard for orchestration, and we are both deeply committed to increasing the momentum of TOSCA to enable it truly gain the adoption it deserves&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>So while VMware may not be, strictly speaking, an open source infrastructure player, it actively supports the open orchestration agenda as a driving force behind its business decisions, and selects its partners with this core value in mind.&nbsp; VMware is also an active member and contributor in open orchestration initiatives such as OSM and Open-O.</p>

<h2>The technology/product behind Cloudify and VMware vCloud NFV integration</h2>
<p>The second criterion for a sustainable partnership is actually having substance behind the solution. By that I mean real product features and integration that would make the two work as first-class citizens in each partner&rsquo;s respective product portfolios.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s the icing on the cake in this partnership.</p>
<p>In the context of Cloudify, this partnership crosses almost all of the leading core VMware products and focal points, and includes the following features and plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li>vCloud, vSphere and VIO support</li>
<li>Cloudify management pack for vRealize Ops</li>
<li>NSX integration</li>
<li>TOSCA/YANG integration</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cloudify's new management pack for vRealize Ops</h2>
<img src="/img/blog/vmware_vrops.png" align="right">
<p>The thing that I&rsquo;m pretty excited about is the Cloudify/vROPs management pack (that is currently in technology preview mode - but is very promising in its capabilities). The management pack lets VMware operators monitor and control all of the Cloudify deployments through the same vROPs tools. This also includes the ability to monitor failure and take corrective actions to repair a failed instance and add instances to increase capacity of the underlying infrastructure. It will also provide a consolidated log view through vRealize log insights. This integration shows that Cloudify can be integrated nicely into the VMware vRealize management suite.</p>
<p>The demo below shows how this integration is going to work (Note: it&rsquo;s in early beta - so expect improvements and tweaks for the GA.&nbsp; Also, feel free to provide feedback, so we can be sure to deliver a stellar final product). In this demo, you can see how it&rsquo;s possible to monitor a Clearwater IMS that was deployed by Cloudify that can now be managed using the vROPs dashboard. VMware operators can view the topology of the Clearwater IMS alongside the actual infrastructure utilization that it runs on through the vROPs management console. It also shows how we can gather the utilization metrics and present them in the context of the IMS service, making vROPs more service aware.</p>

<p class="aligncenter"><a class="hover-wrap fancybox fancybox.iframe" data-fancybox-group="gallery" title="Cloudify Management Pack with VMware vRealize Operations Demo" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LAnhtJzmnZA?enablejsapi=1&amp;wmode=opaque"><img src="/img/cloudify_vrops.png" alt="Cloudify Management Pack for vROps" width="700"></a></p>

<p>In addition, we can see how an operator can take corrective actions in case of a failure or capacity shortage by executing Cloudify workflows directly from vROPs.</p>


<h2>Ecosystem DNA&nbsp;</h2>
<p>VMware comes with a strong partner and ecosystem DNA.</p>
<p>Through our work with the VMware/NFV group, we have brought together many of its ecosystem partners to collaborate and create joint solutions that actually work. In our case, this partnership includes work with <a href="http://www.metaswitch.com/">Meta</a><a href="http://www.metaswitch.com/">s</a><a href="http://www.metaswitch.com/">witch</a>, <a href="http://www.brocade.com/">Brocade</a>, <a href="http://www.athonet.com/">Athonet</a>, and <a href="http://www.versa-networks.com/">Versa</a> to name a few.</p>
<p>In the context of NFV this Ecosystem DNA has become a critical and driving force, as it is clear that a single vendor solution works against the entire idea behind the move to NFV in the first place. At the same time taking the best of breed approach comes with a high toll of complexity and maintenance.</p>
<p>After lots of hurdles at the beginning, I feel that we are starting to see the fruits of this work which at the end of the day provides the flexibility of choosing the best of breed solution, all without the hassle involved with making them to work together.</p>
<p>Our VMware-led collaboration has resulted in the creation of initial set of VNF blueprints&nbsp; that include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T37cNUQVYac">vIMS</a> - through the collaboration with VMware vCloud NFV, MetaSwitch</li>
<li><a href="http://getcloudify.org/2016/08/29/vmware-vcloud-volte-vims-vepc-demo-athonet-nfv-orchestration-hybrid-cloud.html">VoLTE</a> - through the collaboration between VMware vCLoud NFV, Athonet and Cloudify</li>
<li>vCPE - through the collaboration between VMware vCloud NFV, MetaSwitch SBC,Brocade vRouter. and Cloudify.&nbsp;</li>
<li>SD-WAN - through the collaboration between VMware vCloud NFV, Versa, Cloudify</li>
<li>vEPC - and integration Brocade vEPC solution</li>
</ul>
<p>Those solutions are still being developed and are at different levels of maturity, but what&rsquo;s nice to see is that VMware has gotten all of these players to commit real resources to make the collaboration work. I&rsquo;m optimistic that we&rsquo;re on the right path; and we can see these efforts delivering true results are already bearing fruit.</p>
<h2>What&rsquo;s coming up next?</h2>
<p>We have put together an ambitious road map, and are always looking to receive feedback on whether we&rsquo;re on the right track.&nbsp; Below is the list of features, integrations, and support we are hoping to release in our upcoming version.&nbsp; Let us know what you think.</p>
