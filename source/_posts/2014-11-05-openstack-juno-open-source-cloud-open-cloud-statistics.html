  <p>Every now and again we like to do an <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2014/05/19/openstack-statistics.html">OpenStack statistics</a> roundup, usually we do this following the release of their annual report, but recently they sent a quick OpenStack Juno summary, and I thought I would share the highlights, and how this compares to previous reports.</p>

  <p>So, as you all already know, since <a href="http://www.openstack.org/software/juno/">Juno </a>is the <strong><em>"J"</em></strong> release of OpenStack - this is the 10th drop of this open source cloud software.&#160; Where the next up and coming release, discussed at the last design summit is the Kilo release.&#160; </p>

  <p>Where our previous OpenStack stats post mostly discussed how <a href="http://getcloudify.org/openstack-architecture-cloudify.html">OpenStack </a>is being consumed from a technical perspective tools, integrations, users, deployment sizes and more - this post will focus mostly on Juno as a release and the impressive stats from a development and contribution perspective.</p>

  <p>Juno brings with it <strong>97 drivers</strong> and plugins across compute, storage and networking for popular enterprise and open source technologies - including everything from deployment tools such as Puppet, and DevStack, through config tools like <a href="http://getcloudify.org/docker-orchestration-docker-container-deployment-cloud.html">Docker </a>- which is gaining a lot of momentum in the OpenStacksphere.</p>

  <h3><strong>Juno in Numbers</strong></h3>

  <p>This release brings with it <strong>342 new features</strong> and <strong>3,219 bug fixes</strong> across the integrated release and common libraries, marking a <strong>10% increase</strong> in bug fixes from Icehouse. Juno saw a whopping <strong>1,419 contributors</strong> which represents a <strong>16% increase</strong> from the Icehouse release; where the individual contributors are affiliated with <strong>133 organizations worldwide</strong> - and this is evidenced in nearly <strong>700,000 word translations</strong> by the internationalization team with the release!</p>

  <p>The infrastructure team ran <strong>1,776,065 jobs</strong> storing and analyzing <strong>18 terabytes</strong> of log data during the six-month release cycle. These figures include all <strong>440 related projects</strong> making use of OpenStack infrastructure, not just the integrated and incubated projects.&#160; Approximately <strong>500,000 lines</strong> of documentation were modified, along with with a new Architecture Design Guide. It’s interesting to see that many of the top users contributing code are from organizations where the word open source used to be blasphemy: Yahoo!, Time Warner Cable and eBay.</p>
