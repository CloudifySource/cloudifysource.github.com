    In this post I’d like to share some thoughts on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2014/09/11/hybrid-cloud-openstack-multi-cloud.html" target="_blank">managing hybrid clouds</a>, more specifically, hybrid cloud with an open and hybrid stack running on top. I
    don't want to overwhelm with too much detail, so I’m going to focus on the general concept, based on our vision and perspective, on how to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works.html" target="_blank">manage and orchestrate applications</a> on a hybrid cloud with an open source technology stack.

    Orchestration is about automation and intelligent synchronization of multiple dependent processes. We’ve witnessed a major shift in our industry in the
    past decade, in which basic service has become available via standard interfaces. This change allows automation of all the components and services. But
    where we want to get is, in essence, to the point where applications are self-aware, aware of the clouds they run on, and can consume the clouds in most
    efficient way.
</p>

        alt="orchestration as a service"
    />
</p>
<p>
    
    For example, if you're running on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/openstack-architecture-cloudify.html" target="_blank">OpenStack</a>, you want to consume OpenStack resources as best as possible. Or, if you're running on Azure, or even <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2016/09/15/cloud-orchestration-with-azure-openstack-less-explored-hybrid-cloud.html" target="_blank">OpenStack
    and Azure in hybrid cloud mode</a>, you want to be able to consume resources in the best possible manner each platform offers.
</p>
<p>
    
    Our goal is to have the application be self-aware and react based on the its location in the cloud. if we look at a typical application, which is
    multi-tier, has multiple components, multiple virtual IP addresses, etc., all which reside with different components as the basis of the application’s
    architecture. So, you have some parts that use specific networking components, for example, to enable provider networks or to enable GRE tunnels, in
    OpenStack. All these use various types of components and various types of technologies which, together, construct your application. The idea is that we
    have multiple technologies and multiple API's that we can leverage to construct the application.
</p>
<p>
    
    Now, what if we could use all those resources, model our application once, and then use that same model with multiple technologies? For example, if you're
    deploying your application on OpenStack and tomorrow you would like to use containers within that same application, you shouldn't have to model the
    application again or do any manual transitioning of that application. You should be able to consume that application within the same model that you already
    created.
</p>
<h2>
    
    <strong>Different Types of Orchestration</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    
    There are different types of orchestration. Infrastructure-specific orchestration focuses on being able to orchestrate resources of a specific
    infrastructure. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2015/06/11/orchestration-docker-cloud-automation-openstack-heat-tosca-kubernetes.html" target="_blank">OpenStack Heat</a> is a good example of that as it only orchestrates OpenStack resources. In the container world, you have <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2016/07/13/cloudify-and-kubernetes-cluster-hybrid-stack-orchestration-cloud-deployment-automation.html" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> which is an example
    where you use another tool to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/container-docker-kubernetes-orchestration-management-cloud-deployment-automation.html" target="_blank">orchestrate container-based workloads</a>.
</p>
<p align="center">
    
    <img width="500" src="/img/blog/orchestrationtypes.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    
    Cloudify is a pure play orchestrator, able to consume all those types of resources and model the application once using various <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.4.0/plugins/overview/" target="_blank">plugins</a> for other orchestrators, containers, and any other tool in your stack. We use <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2016/05/12/making-tosca-truly-portable-openstack-cloud-nfv-open-source-orchestration.html" target="_blank">TOSCA</a> to model this application and since TOSCA is vendor agnostic, you just
    describe your application and consume the various technologies underneath.
</p>
<h2>
    
    <strong>How TOSCA Works</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    
    TOSCA stands for Topology Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications. It basically works by describing all components in the architecture of your
    cloud application. You can describe <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2016/04/04/scaling-kubernetes-microservices-openstack-TOSCA-orchestration-cloud-open-source.html" target="_blank">microservices</a>, virtual machines, applications, databases and others, defining their dependencies, requirements and
    relationships.
</p>
<p align="center">
    
    <img width="500" src="/img/blog/toscablueprint.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    
    For example, a database which is contained in a virtual machine and an application that's reading data from the database. In this case, you describe the
    topology of that application as part of that modeling process, and then you describe the workflows to deploy and undeploy those applications. These
    workflows could be vendor specific or they could be generalized using the general workflow mechanisms. As part of the workflow definition you describe how
    you want to install or uninstall those specific components that are part of the topology. Lastly, you have the policies where you describe and define the
    policies for what should happen, for example, when your database goes down or when you need to scale out your web application.
</p>
<h2>
    
    <strong>Deploying the Application</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    
    Once you have the TOSCA blueprint ready, Cloudify takes it and, using various plugins, deploys it onto clouds of choice. Cloudify provisions the VMs on
    your cloud using the various plugins, and configures all the components. For example, if your application has some parts using <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/configuration_management_ssh_cloud_orchestration_puppet_ansible_chef_open_source.html" target="_blank">Ansible playbooks</a> or Puppet
    modules to deploy the specific application server, you model the whole thing in the TOSCA application blueprint and then use all the components to
    provision, configure, and manage that application.
</p>
<h2>
    
    <strong>Why Cloudify</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    
    Cloudify lets you integrate all the various tools that you already use and enables you to extend them, whether you are working with a hybrid cloud model or
    containerized and non-containerized components. If you're working with Kubernetes, for example, you can use our <a href="https://github.com/cloudify-examples/kubernetes-cluster-blueprint" target="_blank">Kubernetes plugin</a> which will create a new
    node type as part of that application. You won’t have to change the whole model of the application, only specific components.
</p>
<p align="center">
    
    <img width="500" src="/img/blog/cloudifytosca.png"/>
</p>
<p>
   
    With Cloudify and TOSCA, you can define multiple clouds in the same blueprint, for the same application, using the same orchestration engine, and yes,
    multiple technologies within that application - and deploy them repeatedly without changing your core code.
