  <p>Well, we're keeping things rolling with Episode 2 of the <a href="http://theopensourcepodcast.com" target="_blank">Open Source Podcast</a>! With the advancements and innovation in the <a href="/network-function-virtualization-vnf-nfv-orchestration-sdn-platform.html" target="_blank">NFV</a> space, we decided to continue with that trend and have a discussion with two great guests who participated in the Open Networking Summit in San Jose which took place just a couple weeks ago, along with hosts Nati Shalom and Arthur Berezin. This episode is filled with valuable information, from their experiences from the floor of the conference to lessons <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2017/03/20/onap-driving-standards-nfv.html" target="_blank">ONAP</a> can learn from other open source communities such as <a href="/2016/10/13/hybrid-cloud-orchestration-on-openstack-with-cloudify-tosca.html" target="_blank">OpenStack</a> and <a href="/2016/01/15/what-is-sdn-controllers-software-defined-networking-opendaylight-openflow-openstack-cloudify-network-automation-orchestration.html" target="_blank">OpenDaylight</a> to the developer experience in these projects.</p>
