  <p>We're back with Episode 3 of the <a href="http://theopensourcepodcast.com" target="_blank">Open Source Podcast</a>! This episode, we wanted to focus on, in a lot more detail, what TOSCA means for the cloud application orchestration market, especially on the NFV side in light of the recent release of the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/tosca-nfv/v1.0/tosca-nfv-v1.0.html" target="_blank">TOSCA Simple Profile for NFV</a> Spec in May. You can learn more about why TOSCA is relevant for NFV in <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/nfv/definitions/tosca-nfv-explanation/" target="_blank">this article</a> by SDxCentral.

  <p>Among the topics are a deep dive into the <a href="/nfv" target="_blank">NFV</a> aspect of <a href="/2017/05/23/tosca-times-part-3-model-driven-workflows-cloudify-aria.html" target="_blank">TOSCA</a>, workflows and the declarative, intent-based model of TOSCA, portability, as well as <a href="/2017/07/10/devops-concerto-paris-alien4cloud-cloudify.html" target="_blank">DevOps</a> and the Apache <a href="/2017/04/24/the-tenets-of-cloudify.html" target="_blank">ARIA</a> project which is a real-life TOSCA implementation. There are also questions as to how innovative TOSCA is, but we come back to the fact that TOSCA is not just a de facto standard, but an actual OASIS standard that is truly embraced, and that is the real decision an organization needs to make when thinking about which modeling language to use.</p>

  <p>This great discussion really gets into the nuts and bolts of what TOSCA delivers and where it needs to continue growing.</p>
