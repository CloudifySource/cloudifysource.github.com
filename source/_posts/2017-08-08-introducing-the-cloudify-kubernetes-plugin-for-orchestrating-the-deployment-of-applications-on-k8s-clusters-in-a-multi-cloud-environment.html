<p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> has already become a household name in the <a href="/2017/01/25/orchestrating-kubernetes-managed-virtual-network-function-cloudify.html" target="_blank">container management</a> space since it dropped in 2014. When it comes to orchestration, most <a href="/2017/07/10/devops-concerto-paris-alien4cloud-cloudify.html" target="_blank">DevOps</a> people come back to us with &ldquo;Why orchestrate Kubernetes - it&rsquo;s already an orchestrator of containers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The answer is simple - diverse workloads!</p>

<p>Yes, you want containers, but you also need infrastructure, configuration management, continuous integration, etc. Cloudify enables generic modeling of your whole stack regardless of the IaaS, CM, or any other tool.</p>

<p><a href="/2016/11/09/kubernetes-cluster-orchestration-management-as-a-service-aws-with-cloudify-mist.html" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> is amazing at its job - container scheduling, management, and orchestration of containers. However, it was built to run on a per-cloud basis, so it is going to be incredibly difficult and time consuming, if even possible, to get two clusters - one on AWS and the other on OpenStack, let's say - to talk with each other, scale together, etc. Cloudify brings a higher level of orchestration - it understands the whole ecosystem of clouds, cloud management tools, and the total DevOps stack, including your applications. If you're running apps on multiple clouds with different tools, you need a global orchestrator to ensure your container orchestration tasks are working simultaneously between cloud environments. </p>

<h2>The Plugin</h2>

<p>Currently, the <a href="/plugins" target="_blank">Kubernetes plugin</a> - version 1.2 - currently supports the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lifecycle support for pods and services.</li>
<li>Get master configuration from runtime properties</li>
<li>Add ReplicaSet support</li>
<li>Add PersistentVolume and StorageClass support</li>
<li>Support Google Authentication for GKE</li>
<li>Delete Replica Sets by name</li>
<li>Deployment resource support</li>
<li>Replication Controller support</li>
<li>File resource definition support </li>
</ul>

<h2>Basic Plugin Use Cases</h2>

<p>A prerequisite for using the plugin is to have a Cloudify Manager and Kubernetes cluster running. If you don't already have these, see the <a href="https://github.com/cloudify-examples/cloudify-environment-setup" target="_blank">environment setup example</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cloudify-examples/simple-kubernetes-blueprint" target="_blank">Kubernetes cluster example</a>.</p>

<p>The main use cases for this plugin are:</p>

<ol>
<li> Add new nodes to a cluster</li>
<li> Orchestrate <a href="/2016/12/01/deploying-app-aws-openstack-hybrid-cloud-orchestration-single-cloudify-tosca-blueprint.html" target="_blank">hybrid cloud</a> scenarios with regular services and <a href="/2017/07/20/building-large-scale-services-micro-services-tosca.html" target="_blank">microservices</a> in a single deployment (blueprint)</li> 
<li> Associating pods with particular nodes in your cluster</li> 
</ol>

<h2>Future Integrations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add support for Heapster</li>
<li>Add Helm support</li>
<li>Becoming a Kubernetes Cloud Provider</li>
</ul>
