<p>It’s on, folks! Tokyo is not just around the corner, it’s here - and OpenStack peddlers, developers, fanboys, newbies will all be out there to hear about how everyone is <a href="http://getcloudify.org/openstack-architecture-cloudify.html">using OpenStack</a> to improve the open cloud initiative and push this amazing project forward.</p>

  <p>Our own <a href="http://getcloudify.org/">Cloudify</a> team will also be making their way out east to the Land of the Rising Sun to showcase a few of the things we are working on in OpenStack. We will be talking about all things pure-play, open source orchestration - everything from <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2014/04/19/what-is-nfv-network-function-virtualization-vnf.html">NFV</a> and <a href="http://getcloudify.org/network-function-virtualization-vnf-nfv-orchestration-sdn-platform.html">TOSCA</a> to <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2014/12/14/TOSCA-docker-container-orchestration-microservices-architecture-kubernetes.html">microservices</a> and <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2015/08/26/kubernetes-docker-images-microservices-container-architecture-management-orchestration-tools.html">Kubernetes</a>.</p>

  <p>We are also excited to <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13042505.htm">announce</a> our partnership with Mirantis in creating, and completing, a plugin for Murano that allows users to extend this formerly OpenStack-specific application catalog to any infrastructure, and even deploy and model applications on a hybrid infrastructure. More on that topic in an upcoming blog post.</p>

  <p>Of course, a post about the <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2015/10/22/openstack-liberty-summit-releases-cloud-kubernetes-neutron-nfv.html">OpenStack Summit</a> would not be complete without a nice list of upcoming Cloudify news and activities, so here it is:</p>
