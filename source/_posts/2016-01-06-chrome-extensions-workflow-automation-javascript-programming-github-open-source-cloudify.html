<h2><font style="font-weight: bold">The problem</font></h2>

<p>Every day I find myself in need to track four things: Github pull requests, Flowdock messages, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2014/04/29/testing_automation_continuous_integration.html" target="_blank">continuous integration</a> build status (by Travis-ci), emails.</p>

<p>When I discovered a cool Chrome extension for Gmail, I realized the potential extensions have in increasing my productivity. I decided to search for more extensions that will do the same.&#160; </p>

<p>Unfortunately, it was not an easy task. </p>

<p>Either an extension did not exist or it did not display the data in a way that helped much. </p>

<p>However, all the services I use have an API that is accessible to me. </p>

<p>So I decided to take a small journey and investigate how hard would it be to write my own Chrome extension that would suit my needs. </p>

<p>Turns out that after a small learning curve you can feel right at home since chrome extensions use js, HTML and CSS. plus the Chrome API is very easy and simple to get started. </p>

<p>While there are many ways to actually write an extension, I will focus on one that suited me best and only mention the others briefly. </p>

<p>We will use the Flowdock’s example for the sake of this post. the code is available at: <a href="https://github.com/guy-mograbi-at-gigaspaces/flowdock-chrome-extension" target="_blank">https://github.com/guy-mograbi-at-gigaspaces/flowdock-chrome-extension</a></p>

<p>Here at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/" target="_blank">Cloudify</a> we've actually done some more work on Flowdock.&#160; You can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/hubot-flowdock-irc-relay" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>

<h2><font style="font-weight: bold">The three pages of a Chrome extension</font></h2>

<p>Every Chrome extension has three pages available for its implementation</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Popup - the page displayed when you press the extension icon</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Options - the page displayed when you right click the icon and click ‘options’</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Background - a page which simply runs in the background and is only accessible from the ‘manage extensions’ section in chrome by clicking the ‘inspect &lt;your background page name&gt;’ </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/mAkN-Ll7EVkYOtTu9pCEfJFP9VDkfEnqfyQL6ig0iNyA8NX3_RVicdVYXdVFb-oy3ooVqrUU00MeGDajnxofIyWydBuDolVA_I9MiNpw1rAv9D9YqlvYqbCjGz3NBESBzBg4acgP" width="571" height="188" /></p>

<p>The three pages can communicate by messages, and keep data by using the chrome api (or some online service). </p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<h2><font style="font-weight: bold">Choose your favorite toolset</font></h2>

<p>My favorite combo is Angular, Sass and Grunt, but you can actually use anything you like.&#160; (We've&#160; actually spoken about this toolset in the past in our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2014/11/21/mean-stack-workflow-automation-yeoman-bower-grunt.html" target="_blank">Javascript workflows</a> post).</p>

<p>I also really like Yeoman and its generators, they really help kickstart a project, so I wrote one for my future Chrome extensions and it is available at: <a href="https://github.com/guy-mograbi-at-gigaspaces/generator-angular-chrome-extension" target="_blank">https://github.com/guy-mograbi-at-gigaspaces/generator-angular-chrome-extension</a></p>

<p>I also used the following libraries: </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Materialize.css for its exquisite taste in design and ease of use. thanks materialize!</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Lodash for processing data</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I strongly recommend using Angular as it saves tons of time thanks to its amazing two way binding, plus it is really easy to set up for small projects.</p>

<h2><font style="font-weight: bold">Define you manifest file</font></h2>

<p>In order to have a full work cycle, you first need to declare your files in the extension manifest</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/guy-mograbi-at-gigaspaces/348b12f9ec1a8dda8181.js?file=manifest.json"></script></p>

<p>Not much happening here, pretty generic. the important thing to note is the definition of the three files mentioned above: options, popup and background. </p>

<h2><strong>The popup page</strong></h2>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/guy-mograbi-at-gigaspaces/348b12f9ec1a8dda8181.js?file=popup.html"></script></p>

<p>As you can see I have set up a regular HTML file with an Angular app. There are also comments for the Grunt build process to minimize files. </p>

<p>The special part is in </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>scripts/chrome.js - this is a mock for chrome’s api which only works if the API is unavailable. </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>scripts/popup.js - this is the actual Angular app </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The page will paint messages from Flowdock on the page in a simple list. </p>

<p>Background and options HTML files will actually look the same, so I will allow myself to skip them. (the code is available in Github).</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<h2><strong>The popup.js script</strong></h2>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/guy-mograbi-at-gigaspaces/348b12f9ec1a8dda8181.js?file=popup.js"></script></p>

<p>On the surface this looks like a regular Angular app but there are several interesting things going on here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We are using the chrome API through a wrapper, injected as an Angular service. This service will actually work outside the extension environment as it mocks the API when needed. </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>We are listening for messages and then update the data when a message with data arrives. </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>We send a message requesting to get an update - this code will run once a popup is opened. </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>We are also loading mockData for development. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So far things are pretty straightforward. Let's have a look at the options script.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<h2><font style="font-weight: bold">Options.js</font></h2>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/guy-mograbi-at-gigaspaces/348b12f9ec1a8dda8181.js?file=options.js"></script></p>

<p>Thanks to Angular taking care of two-way binding, all we are left with is loading the data when the page loads, and saving it with a save click. </p>

<p>The HTML will define some inputs fields that will save stuff on scope. </p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<h2><font style="font-weight: bold">The background.js script</font></h2>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/guy-mograbi-at-gigaspaces/348b12f9ec1a8dda8181.js?file=background.js"></script></p>

<p>The background.js differs from the others in that it sets an $interval to run every X time. </p>

<p>What Chrome does is start a process for each extension and run the background page on that process. so if your background page does a lot of computations, you will feel it. Make sure to make it do something every now and then, but mostly rest. </p>

<p>I have set it to get my messages from Flowdock every 10 minutes sounds harmless to me. </p>

<p>The method used to read Flowdock’s message is out of the scope for this post. you are welcome to check the code in Github. </p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<h2><font style="font-weight: bold">The Chrome extension API</font></h2>

<p>So far, all we’ve seen are regular HTML and js files that given a magical api for messages, badge text and save/read configuration look pretty normal. </p>

<p>The glue to make everything work together is the Chrome service. </p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/guy-mograbi-at-gigaspaces/348b12f9ec1a8dda8181.js?file=chrome.js"></script></p>

<p>This file basically wraps the chrome API and defaults to either log prints or some naive implementation. </p>

<p>For example, saveConfig will keep data in Chrome using chrome.storage.sync.set - but if that’s not available it will use the local storage. The same goes for readConfig. </p>

<p>This gives me a way to experience an almost complete flow in my extension while running it from a regular HTTP server. </p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<h2><font style="font-weight: bold">The Gruntfile.js</font></h2>

<p>I will spare you the reading of Grunt’s lengthy configuration. The Gruntfile basically does the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Lints my js files with jshint</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Compiles my sass files when they change</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Minimizes my javascripts</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Copies files to dist folder</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Compresses dist folder to zip</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It also updates the version in the manifest file.</p>

<p>Basically, everything it does on your everyday web project, plus some manifest maintenance for Chrome. </p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<h2><font style="font-weight: bold">Putting it all together</font></h2>

<p>Once you finished writing your extension, all you need to do is compress it, open the “manage extensions”, then drag and drop your zip file there, and you will get a new icon on your extensions bar. </p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<h2><font style="font-weight: bold">Troubleshooting</font></h2>

<p>If you run into any problem, you can easily debug your scripts by inspecting each page. </p>

<p>Popup and options are pretty straight forward to inspect, while background is available for inspection from the ‘extensions’ section in chrome (as shown above).</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<h2><font style="font-weight: bold">Pain &amp; gain</font></h2>

<p>OMG! This task is all gain and no pain. Perhaps some pain in making the Flowdock API work, but that’s actually my fault :). </p>

<p>Chrome’s API is so intuitive, by putting an effort of 10 hours of learning curve - and that’s a serious over-exaggeration now - and a couple of hours of coding the extension, you save yourself hours of work every week. </p>

<p>And now that I have a generator and working code samples, case closed! Just give me more things to track and monitor.. </p>
