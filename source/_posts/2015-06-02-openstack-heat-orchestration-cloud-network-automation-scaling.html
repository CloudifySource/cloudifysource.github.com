<p>This is the second part of our Orchestration tool comparison. You can find part I <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2015/05/20/openstack-summit-vancouver-cloud-network-orchestration-automation-heat-scaling.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><i><b>PLEASE NOTE: This blog post does not offer a fully working example of auto-scaling with TOSCA & Cloudify, only a theoretical example of how it would work. We hope to have a working example in the near future.</b></i></p>

 >TOSCA
is an evolving open standard for a templating language to orchestrate
applications on the cloud. It is not bound to any specific cloud
provider, and is in itself nothing but a templating language, with no
engine to back it up. This is inherently different from </span><a

like the previous post, I’ll recap, any auto-scaling process

</ol>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Q1: The Which</h2>
<br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/shar1z/832914ea8e04279df970.js"></script>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"
 dir="ltr"><span
 >Here
we defined a pretty cool </span><span
 >node_template</span>.<span
 >
It is of type </span><span
 >cloudify.nodes.openstack.Server</span><span
 >,
and it has some additional interfaces to give it monitoring
capabilities. We can see that the </span><span
 >cloudify.interfaces.monitoring_agent</span><span
 >
takes care of installing a monitoring agent called </span><a
 href="http://getcloudify.org/guide/3.2/plugin-diamond.html" target="_blank"
 style="text-decoration: none;"><span
 >Diamond</span></a><span
 >,
and the </span><span
 >cloudify.interfaces.monitoring</span><span
 >
configures the agent with various collectors that gather data from the
host. Remember that with </span><a
 href="http://getcloudify.org/openstack-architecture-cloudify.html#Heat" target="_blank"
 style="text-decoration: none;"><span
 >OpenStack
Heat</span></a><span
 >,
all of this configuration is hidden from the user, but it also exists.
Now let’s define the actual Wordpress application.</span></p>
<br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/shar1z/c96619f0966dbf02eef0.js"></script>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"
 dir="ltr"><span
 >Notice
that we are defining </span><span

well, which tells the monitoring agent on the host to add an </span><a

This is awesome, because we can later use these metrics to do some
intelligent application specific scaling.</span></p>
<br>
<h2>Q2: The What</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"
 dir="ltr"><span
 >Now
we want to understand exactly what the scaling process will do. In
Cloudify, every process is thought of as a </span><a

is a Workflow?</span></a><span

which is essentially an automation process algorithm. Each workflow is
comprised of invocations to interface operations associated with a
specific </span><span
 >node_type</span><span
 >.</span></p>
<br>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"

workflow definition itself is part of the template:</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"

<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"
 dir="ltr"><span
 ><br>Let's
see a small snippet:</span></p>
<br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/shar1z/837e150605fa7ec4e364.js"></script>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"
 dir="ltr"><span
 >Remember
that every </span><span
 >node_template</span><span
 >
implements the lifecycle operations differently, and these are what
embody the difference between scaling a MariaDB instance or a Wordpress
instance. But the process remains the same. Also, because this is all
part of the template itself, and not part of the </span><a

engine</span></a><span
 >,
a user can customize this process how ever he sees fit. </span></p>
<br>
<h2>Q3: The When</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"
 dir="ltr"><span
 >This
part is what TOSCA defines as </span><span
 >Groups
</span><span
 >and
</span><span
 >Policies</span><span
 >.
However, as of writing this post, policies haven’t yet really been
fully designed. Cloudify has its own version of this, which might find
its way to the official spec eventually, but for now, this is how it
looks:</span></p>
<br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/shar1z/c7d15a46b3308591c783.js"></script>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"
 dir="ltr"><span
 >Let’s
break down the elements to understand what’s going on. </span></p>
<br>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"
 dir="ltr"><span
 >For
the most part, we can see that the terms used here are relatively
familiar to us. We have a group called </span><span
 >autoscaling_group</span><span
 > that
defines in its </span><span
 >members</span><span
 >
which nodes will be considered for examination. Notice that we are
specifying the </span><span
 >wordpress</span><span
 >
</span><span
 >node_type</span>,<span
 >
and not the </span><span
 >wordpress_host</span>,<span
 > since we are interested in metrics that are specific to the application, not the host. </span></p>
<br>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"
 dir="ltr"><span
 >We
also define the </span><span
 >scaleup_one_instance</span><span
 > policy, which instructs the Cloudify engine to trigger some action once
the </span><span
 >ReqPerSec</span><span
 >
metric value is above the 1000 threshold for a measurement period of at
least 60 seconds. It is clearly shown what sort of action the engine
will take. This is encapsulated in the </span><span
 >triggers</span><span
 >
section of the </span><span
 >scaleup_one_instance
</span><span
 >policy,
which declares that the </span><span
 >scale</span><span
 >
workflow should be executed with the given parameters, and in our case,
these parameters are telling the engine to add an additional </span><span
 <span
 >wordpress_host</span><span
 >
</span><span
 >instance.</span></p>
<br>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"
 dir="ltr"><span
 >On
the backend side of Cloudify, all of the metrics are stored in a time
series metric database called </span><a
 href="http://influxdb.com/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"><span
 >InfluxDB</span></a><span
 >,
which can be easily queried. Cloudify also provides a very elegant </span><a
 href="https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-rest-client" target="_blank"
 style="text-decoration: none;"><span
 >python
rest client</span></a><span
 >.
With this client you can very easily trigger any kind of workflow you
like:</span></p>
<br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/shar1z/4747f9434543e2ca922f.js"></script>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"
 dir="ltr"><span
 >This
is of course also available via </span><a
 href="http://getcloudify.org/guide/3.2/reference-rest-client-api.html" target="_blank"
 style="text-decoration: none;"><span
 >REST
API</span></a><span
 >.
This means that if a curtain calculation is needed upon which scaling
should be made, and they are not exposed in the policies, it should be
fairly easy to implement this separately.</span></p>
<br>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"
 dir="ltr"><span
 >So,
what did we learn from all of this? The purpose of this post series was
to understand how one can perform automatic scaling on OpenStack, as
well as understand the current gaps in the implementations, and see
what can be improved.</span></p>
<br>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"
 dir="ltr"><span
 >We
saw two different methods, and I think that it is a fair bet to say
that you won’t find any good tools out there that do this in a
completely different manner. So it’s safe to say, that what we just saw
covers pretty much all there currently is.</span></p>
<br>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"
 dir="ltr"><span
 >The
first method was done using the native </span><a
 href="http://getcloudify.org/openstack-architecture-cloudify.html" target="_blank"
 style="text-decoration: none;"><span
 >OpenStack
orchestration</span></a><span
 >
tool, aka, Heat. I think that Heat does a very good job with regards to
what Heat was initially built for, which is orchestrating OpenStack
infrastructure resources. It still feels like they don’t really live
and breathe application orchestration, which makes it difficult to
manage and scale applications, not just infrastructure. The fact that
the scaling process is hard-coded inside the engine might prove to be a
serious limitation for complex use cases, but is actually an advantage
for the most common ones. </span></p>
<br>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"
 dir="ltr"><span
 >The
second way was by using an </span><a
 href="http://getcloudify.org/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"><span
 >open
source orchestration</span></a><span
 >
engine called Cloudify, which adheres to the TOSCA open standard. Using
this tool gives you more native integration with applications of
various sorts, but less integration with OpenStack resources. You might
find that some resource types are not yet supported, but overall it has
very good coverage of the </span><a
 href="https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-openstack-plugin/blob/master/plugin.yaml" target="_blank"
 style="text-decoration: none;"><span
 >OpenStack
API</span></a><span
 >.
Using Cloudify, you have full control over the scaling process. You can
extend and modify the built-in workflow to suit your specific needs,
which is a great ability to have. </span></p>
<br>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"
 dir="ltr"><span
 >Granted,
this will require some python coding at the moment, but plans are being
made to make this workflow composition completely declarative. Another
thing worth mentioning, is the fact that Cloudify is completely cloud
agnostic, it does not rely on built-in type definition or monitoring
capabilities of a specific cloud provider. This is as a direct result
from using a standard like TOSCA, which makes all of it possible using
the concept of a </span><span
 >lifecycle
</span><span
 >interface.
This means that you can take you Cloudify installation and templates,
and migrate or extend your workload to a different cloud provider with
no changes to the scaling-related aspects of the template. </span></p>
<br>
<span
 >I
hope this gives you fairly extensive coverage of the options
out there. Eventually, you will have to think carefully about your use
case and choose the approach that best fits what you’re looking to
achieve. That said, regardless of what that is, you will most
likely find a solution, which is very good news.</span></b>
