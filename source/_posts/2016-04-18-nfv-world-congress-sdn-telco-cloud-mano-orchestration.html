  <p>With all the amazing events happening right around now, we have had to split the <a href="http://getcloudify.org" target="_blank">Cloudify</a> team between them. NFV World Congress is one event that we couldn't miss - and the team will not only be there, one of our own will be joining a very important panel moderated by Intel.</p>

  <p>Our goal for <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2015/10/13/nfv-vnf-network-topology-architecture-automation-tosca-service-chaining-orchestration.html">NFV orchestration</a> is to <i>bring web-scale best practices to the world of NFV</i>.</p>

<h2>Panel Session</h2>
  
  <p>As I mentioned above, our Director Solutions Architect, Amir Levy, will be joining a very high profile and interesting panel run by Intel. Speakers at this panel include the likes of Red Hat, HPE, Ciena, and Rift.io.</p>

  <p>The session is called: <a href="www.layer123.com/nfv-agenda-workshop/#Forum-3" target="_blank">Community-based MANO Projects â€“ Will they Impact the Proprietary Status Quo?</a><br>
    Time: 1:55pm PDT</p>

  <p>We are always excited to meet and discuss anything <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2016/01/21/cloud-vmware-aws-openstack-tosca-vsphere-nfv-hybrid-orchestration.html" target="_blank">NFV MANO</a>, so <a href="mailto:marketing@getcloudify.org">drop us a line</a> to set something up.</p>

  <p>Also, check out our <a href="http://getcloudify.org/cloudifysourcetv.html" target="_blank">library of videos</a> for some great NFV demos.</p>
