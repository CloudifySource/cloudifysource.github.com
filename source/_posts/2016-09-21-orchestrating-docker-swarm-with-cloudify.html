<p><b></b>

<p>The recent release of Docker 1.12 introduced a highly upgraded version of <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/">Swarm</a> baked into it. This new release
    puts native <a href="http://localhost:4000/container-docker-kubernetes-orchestration-management-cloud-deployment-automation.html" target="_blank">Docker container orchestration</a> in direct competition with Google's
    <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2016/07/13/cloudify-and-kubernetes-cluster-hybrid-stack-orchestration-cloud-deployment-automation.html" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a>, although Swarm doesn't match all of
    Kubernetes capabilities yet. The addition of features such as load balanced services,
    scaling, overlay networking, placement affinity and anti-affinity, security and high
    availability make for a compelling platform.</p>

    <h3>Orchestration Strategy for Docker Swarm</h3>

    <p>Having <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2016/05/10/leading-openstack-container-revolution-cloud-nfv-open-source-kubernetes-tosca-orchestration.html" target="_blank">container orchestration</a> native to the Docker platform makes the creation of
    cluster much easier than with Kubernetes. Swarm has a familiar master/worker
    architecture, with the capability of high availability for the master. Swarm uses a
    <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">Raft</a> implementation for leader election
    and consensus storage rather than an external provider (e.g. etcd). It also includes
    built-in overlay networking. The integrated nature of Swarm makes the orchestration
    straightforward.</p>

    <p align="center"><img src="/img/blog/swarm_architecture.png" alt="swarm arch" width="500px" /></p>

    <p>As with the Cloudify <a href="https://github.com/cloudify-examples/kubernetes-cluster-blueprint">Kubernetes
    Cluster Blueprint</a>, the main value delivered by the orchestration of Swarm is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>creating a cluster in an infrastructure neutral way</li>

      <li>auto-healing the cluster when cluster nodes fail</li>

      <li>manual and/or auto-scaling the cluster when arbitrary metrics indicate the
      need.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Given these goals, the orchestration can be fairly simple because they fall into
    well worn patterns that Cloudify supports directly. This initial attempt starts a
    single manager and an arbitrary number of workers. The workers depend on the manager.
    The workers are outfitted with Diamond metric collectors, and scale and heal policies
    are defined in the blueprint. When workers are spun up, the get the security token
    from the manager and join swarm. When they are scaled down, the process is reversed.
    A load generating image is provided in the form of a Dockerfile to ease validating
    the scaling behavior, and part of the orchestration is the generation of the image on
    each worker node.</p>

    <h3>Orchestration Details</h3>

    <p>The blueprint defines two node types corresponding to the different Swarm node
    roles, manager and worker. The blueprint targets Openstack, and each of the roles is
    contained in a corresponding <code>cloudify.openstack.nodes.Server</code> type. The
    worker host nodes are outfitted with standard Cloudify metric collectors. The worker
    nodes are configured to depend on the manager node. The blueprint assumes that Docker
    is preinstalled on the image. While Cloudify could easily automate the install of
    Docker itself, the process is too time consuming to make sense in an auto-scaling use
    case.</p>

    <h3>The Manager</h3>

    <p>The manager stores its cluster token in runtime properties, which is used later by
    workers to join the swarm. The script that enables this is quite simple and is called
    as the result of the manager configuration in the blueprint.</p>

    <div class="highlight highlight-source-yaml">
      <pre>
  <span class="pl-ent">manager:</span>
    <span class="pl-ent">type:</span> <span class=
"pl-s">cloudify.nodes.SoftwareComponent</span>
    <span class="pl-ent">interfaces:</span>
      <span class="pl-ent">cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle:</span>
        <span class="pl-ent">start:</span>
          <span class="pl-ent">implementation:</span> <span class=
"pl-s">scripts/start-manager.sh</span>
          <span class="pl-ent">inputs:</span>
            <span class="pl-ent">process:</span>
              <span class="pl-ent">env:</span>
                <span class="pl-ent">IP:</span> <span class=
"pl-s">{get_attribute: [manager_host, ip]}</span>
    <span class="pl-ent">relationships:</span>
      - <span class="pl-ent">target:</span> <span class="pl-s">manager_host</span>
        <span class="pl-ent">type:</span> <span class=
"pl-s">cloudify.relationships.contained_in</span>
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>Note that the IP of the containing host is passed through the environment to the
    very minimal configuration/startup required by Docker Swarm.</p>

    <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
      <pre>
sudo docker swarm init --advertise-addr <span class="pl-smi">$IP</span>

ctx instance runtime-properties master_token <span class="pl-s"><span class=
"pl-pds">$(</span>sudo docker swarm join-token -q manager<span class=
"pl-pds">)</span></span>
ctx instance runtime-properties worker_token <span class="pl-s"><span class=
"pl-pds">$(</span>sudo docker swarm join-token -q worker<span class=
"pl-pds">)</span></span>
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>To initialize a Swarm manager, only the <code>init</code> command is needed. The
    script then stores away the access tokens for future reference in the node runtime
    properties.</p>

    <h3></a>The Worker</h3>

    <p>The worker configuration is likewise simple and depends on the existence of the
    manager. A first step, to support easy demonstration of scaling, but which could also
    be used as a pattern for loading arbitrary images, is to put the "stress" image on
    each worker. The blueprint indicates this for the worker node as follows:</p>

    <div class="highlight highlight-source-yaml">
      <pre>
  <span class="pl-ent">worker:</span>
    <span class="pl-ent">type:</span> <span class=
"pl-s">cloudify.nodes.SoftwareComponent</span>
    <span class="pl-ent">interfaces:</span>
      <span class="pl-ent">cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle:</span>
        <span class="pl-ent">configure:</span> <span class=
"pl-s">scripts/configure-worker.sh</span>
<span class="pl-s">   ......</span>
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>The configure-worker script uploads an archive from the blueprint that contains a
    Dockerfile and supporting artifacts, and builds it:</p>

    <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
      <pre>
<span class="pl-c"># create image for generating cpu load</span>
ctx download-resource containers/stress.tgz /tmp/stress.tgz
<span class="pl-c1">cd</span> /tmp
tar xzf /tmp/stress.tgz
<span class="pl-c1">cd</span> /tmp/stress
sudo docker build -t stress:latest <span class="pl-c1">.</span>
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>The next step is to actually start the worker and join the swarm. This is
    facilitated by Cloudify intrinsic functions that put required deployment info into
    the environment of the <code>start-worker.sh</code> script:</p>

    <div class="highlight highlight-source-yaml">
      <pre>
        <span class="pl-ent">start:</span>
          <span class="pl-ent">implementation:</span> <span class=
"pl-s">scripts/start-worker.sh</span>
          <span class="pl-ent">inputs:</span>
            <span class="pl-ent">process:</span>
              <span class="pl-ent">env:</span>
                <span class="pl-ent">IP:</span> <span class=
"pl-s">{get_attribute: [worker_host, ip]}</span>
                <span class="pl-ent">MASTERIP:</span> <span class=
"pl-s">{get_attribute: [manager_host, ip]}</span>
                <span class="pl-ent">TOKEN:</span> <span class=
"pl-s">{get_attribute: [manager, worker_token]}</span>
</pre>
    </div>

    <p><code>start-worker.sh</code> then can run the very simple <code>join</code>
    command from Docker to join the cluster:</p>

    <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
      <pre>
sudo docker swarm join --advertise-addr <span class=
"pl-smi">$IP</span> --token <span class="pl-smi">$TOKEN</span> <span class=
"pl-smi">$MASTERIP</span>
</pre>
    </div>

    <h3>Scaling and Healing</h3>

    <p>Worker hosts are installed with standard Cloudify <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.4.0/plugins/diamond/">Diamond Plugin</a> facilitated
    metric collectors for metrics related to cpu, memory, and I/O. Autoscaling
    configuration in Cloudify consists of defining a group, which associates a number of
    blueprint nodes with a policy. The policy dictates under what circumstance the
    scaling (or other workflow) is triggered. The actual workflow (scale/heal or other)
    is associated in the scaling group definition. This means that the policy itself is
    just raising a flag (as it were): it doesn't command a certain workflow to execute,
    or even send parameters to a certain workflow. Since each group is statically defined
    in the blueprint, a separate group must be defined for each potential action. In the
    case of this Swarm blueprint, that means separate groups for scale up, scale down,
    and heal. Looking at the scale up group, you can see the policy association, and the
    policy configuration, which sets the threshold for scaling, the metric to use, and
    other parameters. Note that the actual policy implementation, in
    <code>policies/scale.clj</code>, is not baked into Cloudify itself, but is a general
    purpose autoscaling detection policy that you can reuse in your own blueprints.</p>

    <div class="highlight highlight-source-yaml">
      <pre>
 <span class="pl-ent">scale_up_group:</span>
   <span class="pl-ent">members:</span> <span class="pl-s">[worker_host]</span>
   <span class="pl-ent">policies:</span>
     <span class="pl-ent">auto_scale_up:</span>
       <span class="pl-ent">type:</span> <span class="pl-s">scale_policy_type</span>
       <span class="pl-ent">properties:</span>
         <span class="pl-ent">policy_operates_on_group:</span> <span class=

         <span class="pl-ent">scale_limit:</span> <span class="pl-c1">4</span>
         <span class="pl-ent">scale_direction:</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class=
"pl-pds">'</span>&lt;<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span>
         <span class="pl-ent">scale_threshold:</span> <span class="pl-c1">50</span>
         <span class="pl-ent">service_selector:</span> <span class=
"pl-s">.*worker_host.*cpu.total.user</span>
         <span class="pl-ent">cooldown_time:</span> <span class="pl-c1">120</span>
       <span class="pl-ent">triggers:</span>
         <span class="pl-ent">execute_scale_workflow:</span>
           <span class="pl-ent">type:</span> <span class=
"pl-s">cloudify.policies.triggers.execute_workflow</span>
           <span class="pl-ent">parameters:</span>
             <span class="pl-ent">workflow:</span> <span class="pl-s">scale</span>
             <span class="pl-ent">workflow_parameters:</span>
               <span class="pl-ent">delta:</span> <span class="pl-c1">1</span>
               <span class="pl-ent">scalable_entity_name:</span> <span class=

               <span class="pl-ent">scale_compute:</span> <span class="pl-c1">true</span>
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>Note that <code>scale_policy_type</code> is defined in the imported
    <code>imports/scale.yaml</code> file, which ultimately points at
    <code>policies/scale.clj</code>. The <code>triggers</code> section defines the
    workflow that will be executed (and its parameters) when the policy "raises its flag"
    (actually it calls the <code>process-policy-triggers</code> function). Nothing new or
    exotic here. The scale down group is almost identical, with slightly tweaked policy
    and workflow parameters. The heal group uses the built in <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.4.0/manager_policies/built-in-policies/#host-failure">host
    failure policy</a>, which then triggers the built in <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.4.0/workflows/built-in-workflows/#the-heal-workflow">heal
    workflow</a>.</p>

    <h2>Test Drive</h2>

    <p>In order to test drive the Swarm integration with auto healing and scaling, you'll
    need access to a Openstack cloud and <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.4.0/manager/bootstrapping/">bootstrap a manager</a>
    there. Recall that you'll need an Ubuntu 14+ image with Docker 1.12 installed. Then
    clone the blueprint from the git <a href="wiki/TBD">repo</a> and edit the
    <code>inputs/openstack.yaml</code> file. Upload the blueprint to the manager and
    create a deployment using the inputs. Alternatively, you can create the deployment
    from UI and enter the inputs manually. Run the install workflow on the deployment.
    This will create a Swarm cluster with one manager and one worker.</p>

    <h3>Autoheal</h3>

    <p>From your Openstack Horizon dashboard, terminate the worker instance. Now return
    to the Cloudify Manager UI and note on the deployment view that the heal workflow has
    started.</p>

    <p align="center"><img src="/img/blog/swarm_heal.png" alt="swarm heal" /></p>

    <h3>Autoscale</h3>

    <p>From the Cloudify UI in the deployments view, get the public IP of the Swarm
    manager.</p>

    <p align="center"><img src="/img/blog/swarm_ip.png" alt="swarm ip" /></p>

    <p>You'll need to access to the agent key for the Swarm manager to ssh there. ssh to
    the manager first from the CLI:</p>

    <p><code>cfy ssh</code></p>

    <p>Now ssh to the manager using the IP you got from the UI:</p>

    <p><code>sudo ssh -i /root/.ssh/agent-key.pem ubuntu@&lt;manager-ip&gt;</code></p>

    <p>Now that you're on the Swarm manager host, you can run the pre-installed service
    to generate load:</p>

    <p><code>sudo docker service create --constraint 'node.role == worker'
    --restart-condition none stress /start.sh</code></p>

    <p>This will run the <a href="https://people.seas.harvard.edu/%7Eapw/stress/">stress</a> tool on an arbitrary
    worker. In the current blueprint configuration, only the workers can auto-scale, and
    only metrics from the workers are used to decide whether to scale. This means the
    stress must be limited to worker nodes, which the Docker service placement constraint
    mechanism nicely supplies. Return to the Cloudify deployment view and see the scale
    workflow start:</p>

    <p align="center"><img src="/img/blog/swarm_scale.png" alt="swarm scale" /></p>

    <p>Keep watching for a couple of minutes and another instance will join the cluster.
    Wait around for a few more minutes, and the deployment will scale down automatically
    to accommodate the decreased load.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    <p>Docker Swarm has stepped up big time to become a real competitor in the container
    management space. Cloudify can add value to a Swarm deployment by supplying
    portability, healing, and scaling capabilities beyond the container scaling and
    healing provided by Swarm itself. Cloudify can also orchestrate Swarm services in
    concert with systems external (possibly not containerized) to the Swarm
    infrastructure. The source code is available on <a href="wiki/TBD">github</a>. As
    always, comments are most welcome.</p>
