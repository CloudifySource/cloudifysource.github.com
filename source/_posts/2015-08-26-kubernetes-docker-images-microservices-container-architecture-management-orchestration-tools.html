<p>Cloudify lives at the extreme end of the "unopinionated" spectrum of application orchestration tools.<a href="http://getcloudify.org/2015/06/11/orchestration-docker-cloud-automation-openstack-heat-tosca-kubernetes.html">  Kubernetes</a><a href="http://www.kubernetes.io" target="_blank"> (http://www.kubernetes.io)</a>, on the other hand, is a <a href="http://getcloudify.org/docker-orchestration-docker-container-deployment-cloud.html">container orchestration</a> system that is very opinionated.  For those committed to a container based deployment architecture, it's a great choice, especially for supporting <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2014/12/14/TOSCA-docker-container-orchestration-microservices-architecture-kubernetes.html">microservices</a>, a good reference on this can be found at: <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html" target="_blank">http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html</a>.</p>
<p>For those with a heterogenous environment, possibly including Kubernetes, Cloudify 

provides a solution that can orchestrate everything under one umbrella.  (You can also check out the Cloudify team's excellent talk from OpenStack Vancouver 

on <a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/vancouver-2015/summit-videos/presentation/orchestration-tool-roundup-kubernetes-vs-heat-vs-fleet-vs-

maestrong-vs-tosca" target="_blank">just this topic</a>).</p>

<p>This post reviews some recent work I've done to provide a means for Cloudify to manage Kubernetes clusters at a high level as part of a heterogenous 

environment.

<h3><strong>Integration Overview</strong></h3>


<p>Perhaps the most fundamental integration with Kubernetes would be to assume an already existing cluster, and simply connect to it and issue commands.  

While this is a valid use case, it was a little too basic for my taste.  So the initial ambition was to use Cloudify to install a Kubernetes cluster on bare metal (or 

bare VMs in my case).</p>

<p>The approach was to create a <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2015/01/06/cloudify-cloud-open-source-workflow-engine-automation-template-tools-

plugin.html">Cloudify plugin</a> that defined a couple of types that represented the basic components of a Kubernetes cluster: a master node and a minion 

node.  The master host in Kubernetes is equivalent to the manager host in Cloudify.  Minions manage the container lifecycle on hosts across the cluster.  Since 

Google provides handy <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2015/04/26/dockerfile-docker-container-tutorial-images-cloud-vm.html">docker images</a> for the 

various component services of Kubernetes, I used these and automated Google's instructions for <a 

href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/release-1.0/docs/getting-started-guides/docker-multinode" target="_blank">setting up a multi-node 

cluster</a>.  

<p>So in a kind of odd twist, Cloudify is orchestrating <a href="http://getcloudify.org/tags/Docker/index.html">docker containers</a> to enable a system that 

orchestrates docker containers.  The main difference between Cloudify's "normal" container orchestration and the approach described here, is that each 

individual container isn't a blueprint node.  The blueprint nodes represent the hosts only.  Once Kubernetes is up and running, it's on it's own, at least in this initial 

bare metal version.


<h3><strong>Running it</strong></h3>
<p>This initial version only supports Ubuntu (only tested on Ubuntu 14), and assumes that docker is preinstalled and running.  It also assume that Python and 

apt-get is installed, has internet access, and has passwordless ssh and sudo setup.  Grab the source at: <a href="http://github.com/dfilppi/cfy3/kub" 

target="_blank">(http://github.com/dfilppi/cfy3/kub)</a>.</p>

<p>This post was written for release 1.4. Edit the "barevm-blueprint" and put in your IP addresses and ssh info.
<br/>Install a <a href="http://getcloudify.org/guide/3.2/installation.html">Cloudify CLI</a>, and run:

<code>cfy local install-plugins -p barevm-blueprint.yaml</code>
<br/><code>cfy local init -p barevm-blueprint.yaml</code>
<br/><code>cfy local execute -w install</code>
<br/>Enjoy your new Kubernetes cluster.</p>


<h3><strong>Plugin Design
</strong></h3>
<p>The initial plugin design is quite simple, and only defines two node types, master and minion, and a relationship.  Currently, since the initial support is for 

bare metal, IP addresses and ports are encoded directly into the blueprint.  Since the Kubernetes cluster is being treated as a separate entity, agentless 

orchestration is used via the <a href="http://getcloudify.org/guide/3.2/plugin-fabric.html">Fabric plugin</a>.  This was deemed appropriate because Kubernetes 

provides its own container management and scaling capabilities.  A nice side effect is that the blueprint can be run easily in<a href="http://cloudify-

cli.readthedocs.org/en/3.2/commands.html#local" target="_blank">local mode</a>.  It currently only stands up a Kubernetes cluster, it does not have logic to 

tear it down or run related workflows yet.</p>


<h3><strong>Implementation Details

</strong></h3>

<p>The current implementation utilizes the Cloudify Fabric (ssh) plugin, and essentially boils down to automating the steps outlined in Google's documentation 

for multi-node docker-based installation.  The example blueprint is very concise and can be executed directly from the Cloudify local mode (without starting a 

Cloudify manager).


<script src="https://gist.github.com/dfilppi/2b4653dc7a8aad796c8e.js"></script>

<p>IPs are specified, since the cluster is being constructed on existing running hosts (running Ubuntu 14.04).  Each of the node types has a Fabric task script 

that is run to set up its particular kind of host (master or minion/node).  The custom relationship merely passes the IP address and port from the master to the 

minion for use in its setup. The ssh_username and key are passed along to Fabric so it can connect and run commands and move files.  


<h3><strong>Limitations and next steps

</strong></h3>
<p>This is a simple first step.  Over time more features and use cases will be added.
<ul>
<li>More OS support (CoreOS particularly)</li>
<li>Custom workflows for performing lifecycle operations on the Kubernetes cluster (basically kubectl commands wrapped as workflows)
</li>
<li>Full lifecycle support (uninstall)</li>
<li>Cloud blueprint with agents to take advantage of Cloudify's VM level auto-healing.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Kubernetes is a great system for managing containers and to some degree applications in those containers.  Cloudify can be used to manage Kubernetes 

in a blended environment of containers, virtualization, Cloud platform, and bare metal.</p>
