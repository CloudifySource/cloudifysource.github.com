  <p>We're really pumped for this year's Mobile World Congress! The Cloudify team has been unleashed and will be making a splash in the telco arena. We have partnered with Intel and VMware to show off some cool new demos that will knock your socks off.</p>

  <p>Our big focus at this year's event is NFV orchestration and automation in a Multi-VIM environment. As I noted, we have two really amazing videos that will be on display at the Intel and VMware booths.</p>

<h2>Data Plane Acceleration and Enhanced Platform Awareness in a Multi-VIM Environment</h2>

  <p>Data Plane Acceleration is key to NFV adoption, which is requires virtualized cloud infrastructures to deliver high performance. For these network functions, generic hardware doesn't cut it. And, even with hardware optimized for DPA, you still need the VNFs and environment to support it. EPA and intelligent orchestration are the keys to delivering the automation and efficiency required in an NFV environment. At MWC, Cloudify, with its TOSCA-based orchestration, will demonstrate Data Plane Acceleration and Enhanced Platform Awareness on both OpenStack and VMware in a multi-VIM environment at <strong>Intel Booth #3D30 (Hall 3)</strong>.

<h2>Orchestrating a vIMS in a Multi-VIM Environment</h2>

  <p>Metaswitch and Cloudify have joined forces to enable carriers to use the Clearwater Core IMS on VMware and OpenStack. Cloudify, following the ETSI MANO specification, provides Multi-VIM support on OpenStack VMware Integrated OpenStack, and vCloud Director. Watch the demo at <strong>VMware Booth #3K10 (Hall 3)</strong> where we will be jointly demonstrating the open source orchestration of a vIMS multi-VIM deployment using Clearwater.</P>
  

  <p>The demos will also be avialable to watch after the event as we will upload the to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/cloudifysource" target="_blank">YouTube page</a>.</p>

  <p>Stay tuned for some more great content during the event on <a href="http://getcloudify.org/tags/NFV/index.html" target="_blank">everything NFV</a>.</p>
