  <p>We're really pumped for this year's Mobile World Congress! The <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">Cloudify</a> team has been unleashed and will be making a splash in the telco arena. We have partnered with Intel and VMware to show off some cool new demos that will knock your socks off.</p>

  <p>Our big focus at this year's event is <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2015/10/13/nfv-vnf-network-topology-architecture-automation-tosca-service-chaining-orchestration.html" target="_blank">NFV orchestration</a> and automation in a Multi-VIM environment. As I noted, we have two really amazing videos that will be on display at the Intel and VMware booths. <a href="mailto:marketing@getcloudify.org">Contact us</a> if you want to meet!</p>

<h2>Data Plane Acceleration and Enhanced Platform Awareness in a Multi-VIM Environment</h2>

  <p>Data Plane Acceleration is key to NFV adoption, which is requires virtualized cloud infrastructures to deliver high performance. For these network functions, generic hardware doesn't cut it. And, even with hardware optimized for DPA, you still need the VNFs and environment to support it. EPA and intelligent orchestration are the keys to delivering the automation and efficiency required in an NFV environment. At MWC, Cloudify, with its TOSCA-based orchestration, will demonstrate Data Plane Acceleration and Enhanced Platform Awareness on both <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2016/01/15/what-is-sdn-controllers-software-defined-networking-opendaylight-openflow-openstack-cloudify-network-automation-orchestration.html" target="_blank">OpenStack</a> and VMware in a multi-VIM environment at <strong>Intel Booth #3D30 (Hall 3)</strong>.

<h2>Orchestrating a vIMS in a Multi-VIM Environment</h2>

  <p>Metaswitch and Cloudify have joined forces to enable carriers to use the <a href="http://www.projectclearwater.org/" target="_blank">Clearwater</a> Core IMS on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/vmware-hybrid-cloud.html" target="_blank">VMware</a> and OpenStack. Cloudify, following the ETSI MANO specification, provides Multi-VIM support on OpenStack, VMware Integrated OpenStack, and vCloud Director. Watch the demo at <strong>VMware Booth #3K10 (Hall 3)</strong> where we will be jointly demonstrating the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2014/11/02/NFV-openstack-TOSCA-open-source-cloud-Chef.html" target="_blank">open source orchestration</a> of a vIMS multi-VIM deployment using Clearwater.</P>
