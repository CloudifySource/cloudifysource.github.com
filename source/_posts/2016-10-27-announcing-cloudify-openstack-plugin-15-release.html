<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that <a href="http://getcloudify.org/openstack-architecture-cloudify.html" target="_blank">OpenStack</a> has joined the ranks of the top cloud software platforms. They are showing consistent growth year over year with a vast community of developers working, upstream and downstream, to drive this open source cloud platform forward.</p>

<p>In an effort to keep our users as updated as possible about <a href="http://getcloudify.org/" target="_blank">Cloudify</a>, we are announcing the latest release of our OpenStack Plugin - version 1.5.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The latest update gives sysadmins a better user experience with Cloudify, allowing users to manage and control their OpenStack configurations in a more simple, automated fashion. Here are some of the interesting features added in this version:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create projects, assign existing users with roles, and customize quotas - Cloudify can automate the creation of a new project, assign users, and fix quotas directly from the blueprint.</li>
<li>Create image from file (local workflow only) or url - Cloudify now allows uploading a local image via Glance to create a new image in OpenStack.</li>
<li>Boot server from volume - Cloudify supports booting a server from block storage and not only from an image, as was the case in previous versions.</li>
<li>Get MAC address from port after creation - The Cloudify API can now be used to find the MAC address of any port.</li>
</ul>

<p>These features, along with clearer error handling and reporting, are now available using the latest <a href="https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-openstack-plugin">OpenStack plugin</a>. You can also see the <a href="https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-openstack-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.txt">full changelog</a> on Github. Feel free to star the repo to follow our progress. We have some more important updates coming to Cloudify and our OpenStack plugin in the next few months.</p>
<h2>Samples</h2>
