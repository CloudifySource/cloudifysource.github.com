  <p>VMworld Europe is back! It's time to gather around and talk with the pros all about the latest and greatest in VMware virtualization. And we are all ready for action at Pod B in the New Innovator Pavilion talking <a href="http://getcloudify.org/network-function-virtualization-vnf-nfv-orchestration-sdn-platform.html" target="_blank">open source NFV orchestration</a>. In fact, we <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161012005061/en/VMware-GigaSpaces-Collaborate-Drive-Open-Network-Functions" target="_blank">recently announced</a> our collaboration with VMware and their vCloud® NFV™ Platform. Open, standards-based orchestration for NFV is a big deal, and VMware is making real strides toward this goal for operators and telecoms with their carrier-grade platform.</p>

  <p>The idea of open source, open standard orchestration in NFV has been something we have seen become a true force in the telecom and operator markets, especially with the move to <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/giganati/the-road-to-cloud-native-vnfs" target="_blank">cloud-native VNFs</a>. To that end, we created <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2016/06/23/introducing-cloudify-telecom-edition-open-source-nfv-orchestration-goodness-cloud-mano-vnf-deployment.html" target="_blank">Cloudify Telecom Edition</a> with built-in support and blueprints for <a href="http://getcloudify.org/openstack-architecture-cloudify.html" target="_blank">OpenStack</a>, as well as the entire <a href="http://getcloudify.org/vmware-hybrid-cloud.html" target="_blank">VMware stack</a>, including vCloud Director, VMware Integrated OpenStack and vSphere. It also enables extensibility of hybrid workloads and microservices, as well as bursting to public clouds for disaster recovery applications.</p>

  <p>Cloudify is also a huge proponent of open standards driving innovation around NFV, and we take an active role in supporting and sponsoring organizations building these solutions and standards including: <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2016/05/12/making-tosca-truly-portable-openstack-cloud-nfv-open-source-orchestration.html" target="_blank">Oasis TOSCA</a>, OPNFV, Open-O, as premiere members, MEF, and ETSI.</p>

  <p>Some of the work we have been doing with VMware includes full <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2016/08/29/vmware-vcloud-volte-vims-vepc-demo-athonet-nfv-orchestration-hybrid-cloud.html" target="_blank">orchestration and management of Athonet's vIMS and vEPC</a> using a <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2015/07/21/what-is-TOSCA-cloud-application-orchestration-tutorial-cloudify.html" target="_blank">TOSCA blueprint</a>. Cloudify acts as the NFVO and VNFM on top of VMware vCloud. This demo, which you can see by clicking below, also won the <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2016/06/16/vmware-athonet-demo-fastest-deployment-virtualized-lte-mobile-packet-core-volte-service-with-cloudify-win-tokyo-interop-best-of-show-award.html" target="_blank">Tokyo InterOp Award</a> for Best In Show. We've also created a Cloudify management pack for VMware vRealize Ops - more on that in the next few days.</p>

  <p>Another very interesting use case is the work that the team from Orange Labs has been doing with their <a href="http://getcloudify.org/2016/06/21/opnfv-functest-team-tests-clearwater-vims-deployment-using-cloudify-with-100-percent-success-nfv-orcehstration.html">Functional Testing (Functest) team at OPNFV</a>. In the blog post written by their team, they stated as follows: "To manage a complex VNF, it’s necessary to use an orchestrator and we selected Cloudify because it fits all the vIMS test-case requirements (open source solution, workflow, TOSCA modeling, good integration with OpenStack components, openness with plugins…)."</p>

  <p>The Cloudify team will be on site at <a href="https://www.vmworld.com/en/europe/index.html">VMworld </a>to demo these various use cases. We are across the main VMware booth in the New Innovator Pavilion and you can catch our hands-on lab at the VMware booth. We are also going to be running some demos at the Intel booth, so you can catch us in quite a few places.</p>
