						<h1><strong>NFV Management & Orchestration</strong> with TOSCA</h1>
						<p>NFV, (network function virtualization), is the growing need by Telcos and enterprises to deploy, manage and scale their network functions and services on standardized hardware.  Cloudify,  provides the full end-to-end lifecycle of NFV orchestration – from installation and deployment through monitoring of KPIs, with automatic action taking such as auto-healing and auto-scaling based on metrics -- i.e. Day 0 through Day 2 support -- all through a simple TOSCA-based YAML blueprint.  This significantly simplifies the complexities involved with exposing networking elements to the user by abstracting the networking piece of the deployment into an application blueprint, all while enabling the hardening of security to match the application topology exactly.</p>

				<h2><strong>Pure-Play Standard-Driven NFV Made Easy</strong></h2>
				<p>Many big Telcos have chosen and are evaluating Cloudify in large part due to it being open source, as well as modular in nature, enabling pluggability with existing and new toolsets and environments.  On top of this, Cloudify provides many plugins to interface with peripheral network databases, such as DNS and LDAP, and has already demonstrated its capabilities to orchestrate large subsystems like IMS, internet activation and provisioning per tenant out of the box .  With the ability to have one manager that supports multiple clouds (from VMware to OpenStack) as well as multiple data centers and availability zones, Cloudify, is very attractive to mid to large Telcos, ISPs, and enterprises with a hybrid cloud model.  </p>

				<p>VMware is just one such company that has selected Cloudify as their orchestration platform of choice to launch applications and VNFs on vCloud Air.

					<h3><b>Use Case: NFV in a Week with Open Source Tooling</b></h3>

					<p>A major Telco was looking to  expand its offering to provide on-demand internet connectivity for small to medium-sized offices.  This would include a web portal that provides a simple experience to choose an internet provider, as well as infrastructure considerations -- speed, security, and VPN - and any other additional services required, instantaneously, and get connected.  Much like on-demand cloud resources.</p>
					<p>To be able to truly be able to offer such an added value service, this entire process would need to be automated, be able to support the connection to many devices that are software driven, with consistent management and orchestration.</p>
					<p>To do so, they realized they would need an NFV architecture, coupled with a standard-driven orchestration engine to provide the backbone for this virtualized networking environment. </p>

					<p>Through the Cloudify orchestrator the Telco was able to define a TOSCA blueprint that brings up all of the pieces in the architecture, and places them in the right service chain.</p>

					<p> This was how the overall architecture looks, it is comprised of two main parts:</p>

					<ul>
					<li>Shared services which are part of the carrier backend.</li>
					<li>A set of services that are created per tenant/customer as part of the internet activiation process – that includes services like vfirewalls, vDPI, vRouter and VPN connectivity.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In some cases Tail-F was also used to configure the network devices after they have been established.</p>

					<p>This was achieved through the following workflow:</p>

			<h2><b>Cloudify & ETSI's MANO</b></h2>
			<p>ETSI, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, defined a standard reference architecture to achieve NFV, where an integral part of this architecture is the MANO - the NFV management and orchestration layer.</p>  
			<br/>
			<img style="float: left; display: inline" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/ETSIdiagram.png" width="550" align="left" /> 
			<p><strong>MANO based on TOSCA</strong></p>
			<p>MANO is the layer defined by ETSI that manages and orchestrates the cloud infrastructure and resources, and it is comprised of the following elements:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>The VIM (Virtual Infrastructure Manager), essentially controls the interaction of the VNF with the compute, networking and storage resources of the chosen NFVI (i.e. cloud or virtualization layer).</li>
			<li>The VNFM (Virtual Network Function Manager), is responsible for the VNF lifecycle management -  e.g. it takes action on instantiation, termination, failover, scaling in and out, and more.</li>
			<li>The NFV Orchestrator (which is where Cloudify comes in), as its name implies, basically serves the purposes of orchestrating and managing the software and infrastructure resources of the VIM, and realizing the NFVI’s network services.</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<p>ETSI's MANO is intended to provide the full end-to-end lifecycle of NFV orchestration and management – from installation and deployment through post-deployment, or in the telco industry terminology - Day 0 through Day 2 support.
			</p>

			<p>As MANO is currently just a guideline all implementations of MANO are proprietary, aside from the TOSCA-based agnostic implementation that also enables the plugging in of additional standards like YANG/Netconf for service chaining. </p> 

			<p>The telco industry is known to be very standard driven, therefore, the alignment with MANO is an important element for NFV adoption, where many Telcos and Enterprises these days are searching for modeling languages to help achieve the goal of application and network orchestration, and are betting on OpenStack and the nature of standards-driven open source cloud to help deliver this in the real world. This is where the importance and adoption of a standard like TOSCA becoming an important criterion in the choice of an orchestration platform.</p>

			<p>TOSCA has the combination of declarative descriptions of the application topology with all its components - including the load balancer, network, the compute resources, software and everything else, along with an imperative set of workflows to describe the logic of any process we need to automate. What this means from an NFV perspective, is that TOSCA is very good when it comes to defining virtual application topologies, VNF dependencies and relationships, actions to be performed as part of a lifecycle. This significantly simplifies the complexities involved with exposing networking elements and  end-to-end lifecycle management for NFV, by abstracting the networking piece of the deployment into an application blueprint.</p>
