						<h1><strong>TOSCA Orchestration for Your VMware Stacks</strong>  Powered by Cloudify</h1>
						<p>VMware has been a leader of the enterprise virtualization space for many years and is by far the most popular industry solution to date.  On top of their virtualization solutions, VMware has also entered the cloud arena with private and public cloud offerings - from vCloud&reg; through vCloud&reg; Air<sup>TM</sup>. Cloudify integrates natively with the VMware stack, including vCloud® Air™, Cloud Director, VMware Integrated OpenStack and vSphere®. </p>

						<p>Through the VMware-Cloudify integration, users now have a framework for automating the installation, deployment and post-deployment processes (such as monitoring, self-healing, auto-scaling and continuous delivery) of applications in a consistent manner across the VMware stack using a standards-based deployment (TOSCA). VMware users can also use Cloudify to extend their VMware environment into other clouds - including <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/openstack-architecture-cloudify.html">OpenStack</a>, to form a true hybrid cloud, as well as for pure-play <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/network-function-virtualization-vnf-nfv-orchestration-sdn-platform.html">NFV orchestration.</p>

					<h2><strong>TOSCA-based Orchestration Across the VMware Stack</strong></h2>
					<p> Cloudify blueprints are based on the Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA).TOSCA provides an industry standard format for describing an application blueprint. Using the TOSCA standard as its templating language, Cloudify makes transparent any changes at the lower level infrastructure and, thus is able to easily migrate workloads across environments. </p>
					<p>By creating TOSCA blueprints, vCloud Air users can fully automate the deployment and configuration of services, from the network and infrastructure up to the application, in a standard based declarative format.</p>

										<br/>
					<div class="aligncenter">
					<img src="img/vmware-TOSCA.jpg" width="700"></div>

					<br/>
					<p>The support for all three VMware environments provides VMware users with a common management and automation framework. This makes it possible to easily build a VMware hybrid cloud with vCloudAir as the public cloud, and vSphere/vCenter or even OpenStack as private cloud.</p>

					<p>Cloudify supports a range of application packaging and configuration management starting from a simple script based packages to Chef, Puppet, SaltStack and now also Docker.  This allows VMware users to leverage their existing investment in any of those frameworks and include Cloudify as a complementary platform to their existing environment.</p>

					<p>Cloudify is also available as a free service to vCloud Air users within the vCloud® Air™ Blueprinting Service.</p>

					<h2><strong>NFV Orchestration for VMware</strong></h2>
					<p> Cloudify automates the provisioning, deployment, monitoring and remediation of NFV services. As Cloudify is an engine that can serve as the ETSI/MANO orchestrator, it has been specifically designed to automate the deployment of networking services such as LDAP, DHCP, IMS etc.</p>

										<br/>
					<div class="aligncenter">
					<img src="img/vmwarenfv.png" width="700"></div>

					<br/>

					<p>Cloudify is also the only open source orchestration platform with native support for VMware vCloud for NFV platform. The integration of Cloudify & VMware provide a truly open NFV orchestration by leveraging open service blueprinting using TOSCA. VMware support for both OpenStack with VMware Integrated OpenStack (VIO) and VMware vCloud Director combined with Cloudify support for both environments provides a powerful flexibility for customers who can choose between the two infrastructures while at the same time managing their application across the two environments through a single pane of glass.</p>

					<p>Users can maximize the utilization of their existing VMware infrastructure combined with a new OpenStack environment. They can also mix and match services between environments to manage hybrid cloud architectures, achieving automated lifecycle management of critical network functions and services. Cloudify brings enhanced knowledge of the application requirements and architecture through application driven orchestration. It ensures best performance and SLA by correlating application requirements with the infrastructure capacity. The integration with VMware enables the application requirements with VMware infrastructure in both the network and compute domains.</p>
