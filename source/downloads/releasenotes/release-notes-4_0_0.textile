<h2 id="">What's New</h2>
<h2>Cloudify Manager </h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/4.0.0/manager/implement-multi-tenancy/"><strong>Multi-Tenancy</strong></a> This version of Cloudify introduces the concept of multiple tenants in Cloudify Manager, for Premium customers. Multi-tenancy enables you to create multiple independent logical groups as isolated environments that can be managed by a single Cloudify Manager. A tenant is a logical entity that contains all its resources, for example blueprints, deployments and workflows. All operations are performed within a tenant. <br /><br />A single default tenant is created during Cloudify Manager installation, and you add other tenants as required. You can assign users and user groups to each tenant and assign user roles, enabling you to specify the content within Cloudify Manager that users are able to access and manage. User management can be integrated with your LDAP/AD setup.<br /><br /><em>In the case of Community Edition users, a single tenant with a single user is created during installation. When you log into Cloudify Manager, the built-in credentials are used.</em><br /><br />The default tenant cannot be deleted. <br /><br></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/4.0.0/manager/high-availability-clusters/"><strong>Clustering Cloudify Managers for High Availability</strong></a> Premium customers now have the ability to cluster multiple Cloudify Manager instances, to ensure resilience in the event of a manager becoming unavailable. <br /><br />One Cloudify Manager is designated as the active manager and the others (two) are designated as hot standbys that are constant mirrors of the data of the active manager. In the event that the active Cloudify Manager fails, an automatic failover switch activates one of the hot standbys. <br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/4.0.0/manager_webui/configure-display/"><strong>User Interface</strong></a> A new user interface is displayed on Cloudify Manager. The user interface enables you to create dashboards that are:</li>
<ul>
<li>Easily and intuitively configured, to build a personalized view of the specific data that most interests you</li>
<li>Write your own widgets, whether their data is Cloudify based or from external systems, and to integrate them as part of your Cloudify dashboard.</li>
<li>Support different views, according to the user role.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/4.0.0/manager/implement-multi-tenancy/"><strong>LDAP Integration</strong></a> LDAP/AD (a Premium user feature) integration is improved from previous versions. You configure Cloudify with the LDAP configuration during the bootstrap process, or via the API (on a clean Cloudify Manager.) <br /><br />When a user logs in to Cloudify Manager, their credentials are passed to the LDAP/AD service for authentication.Following authentication, the user is able to access any tenants in the Cloudify Manager to which they have been assigned, either as an individual or as part of an assigned LDAP group.<br /><br />LDAP passwords are no longer stored in the Cloudify database. Authentication is performed via LDAP and a token is generated and used for the user session.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Web User Interface</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Web user interface, for Premium edition users, has been upgraded to provide a more streamlined user experience. </li>
<ul>
<li>Out-of-the-box dashboards display widgets for the most commonly required data and viewing preferences.</li>
<li>The dashboards are customizable so that you can easily and intuitively configure them to build a personalized view for the specific data that interests you most.</li>
<li>You can create your own dashboard pages.</li>
<li>You can write your own widgets, regardless of whether their data is Cloudify-based or derived from external systems, and integrate them as part of your Cloudify dashboards.</li>
<li>The display of different views according to the user roles (users/admins) is supported.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Cloudify Command-Line Interface</h2>

<ul>
<li>The following commands have been added to the CLI:</li>
<ul>
<li>profiles</li>
<li>tenants</li>
<li>cluster</li>
<li>users</li>
<li>user-groups</li>
<li>ldap</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The following commands have been removed from the CLI:</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>recover<strong> </strong></strong></li>
<li>teardown</li>
</ul>
</ul>


<ul>
<li><strong>Technical Preview Feature</strong> <strong><br /></strong>In the CLI, you can create resources that are private to your account that will not be shared across the tenant. The CLI optional argument is --private-resource.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/4.0.0/manager_architecture/security/">Security</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Cloudify includes built-in user roles with which users are associated. Each role has different permissions, ensuring a role-based access control operation.<br /><br />Cloudify supports the concept of users, user groups, and tenants. These elements can be either defined locally in Cloudify, or taken from an external user management system (LDAP integration is native). In the latter case, passwords are not stored in Cloudify, authentication is performed via LDAP and a token is generated and used for the user session.<br /><br />Communication from the outside world to Cloudify Manager and its SSL/TLS configuration is the user&rsquo;s responsibility (CA/host verification, etc.), where the endpoints include the UI and REST API. <br /><br />If an self-signed certificate is used, you must use the following commands from the UI machine in order for the UI to be available:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>/etc/sysconfig/cloudify-stage</strong><strong><br /></strong>NODEJS_HOME=/opt/nodejs<br />STAGE_HOME=/opt/cloudify-stage<br />NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0</p>
<p>Then run sudo systemctl restart cloudify-stage to restart the cloudify-stage service.<br /><br />Communication between Cloudify agents and Cloudify Manager (and within Cloudify Manager) is the responsibility of Cloudify, and is determined by Cloudify. Cloudify generates the necessary certificates for internal communication.<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>SSL is enabled for agent-manager communication. All communications between the client the server are encrypted. When a connection is established, Cloudify Manager presents a signed certificate to the client. The client can use that certificate to validate the authenticity of the manager.<br /><br /></li>
<li>A secret store is implemented inside the Cloudify PostgreSQL database, which provides a tenant-wide variable store.<br /><br /></li><a name="migrating"></a>
<li>Security operations, such as authenticating success or failure and user details, are audited in dedicated log file on the management server.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Migrating from Cloudify 3.4.x to Cloudify 4.0.0</h2>
<p>To migrate from Cloudify 3.4.x to Cloudify 4.0.0, you must create a snapshot of your 3.4.x machine, to upload to Cloudify 4.0.0. Follow this procedure perform the migration.</p>
<p><strong>Migration Procedure</strong></p>
<p><strong>P</strong><strong>REREQUISITE</strong></p>
<p>Before taking the snapshot, verify that there are not any instances of node ID or deployment ID that include an underscore. For example, change node_ID to node-ID.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Take a snapshot of Cloudify 3.4.x according to the <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.4.2/manager/snapshots/">installation instructions</a> in the Cloudify 3.4.x documentation.</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Install Cloudify 4.0.0 according to the <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/4.0.0/installation/installation-overview/">installation instructions</a> in the Cloudify 4.0.0 documentation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On the newly installed manager, upload and restore the 3.4 snapshot. <br />You can restore a snapshot to a manager that does not have any data on it (clean), or to one with existing content.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The snapshot is uploaded to the tenant on which you performed the upload operation.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Restore the uploaded snapshot into a specific tenant by specifying a new (unique) tenant name. The tenant is created as part of the restore process, and is populated with the snapshot content.</p><a name="new"></a>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restoration using the CLI is described <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/4.0.0/cli/snapshots/">here</a>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Restoration from the UI is described <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/4.0.0/manager_webui/plugins-snapshots-page/">here</a>.</li>

<li>Resource sharing between tenants is not available.</li>
<li>You can only delete tenants or user groups if they are empty, and users if they are unassigned.</li>
<li>LDAP is not supported for nested groups.</li>
<li>You cannot customize password strength rules.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Issues</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloudifysource.atlassian.net/browse/CFY-6660">CFY-6660</a> - REST calls do not support private resource and resource creator fields. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Web User Interface</h2>

<li>The interface only supports uploads of public resources.</li>
<li>The created-by field is not displayed.</li>
<li>High availability is not supported in the user interface.</li>
<li>Multiple Cloudify Managers are not supported in the user interface.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Issues</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloudifysource.atlassian.net/browse/CFY-6673">CFY-6673</a> - Deletion of plugins is implemented using the --force flag. A plugin will be deleted even if it is in use.</li>
</ul>
<h2>CLI</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloudifysource.atlassian.net/browse/CFY-6616">CFY-6616</a> - If you delete a Cloudify Manager and you are using the CLI as a client, you must delete the CLI profile of the manager.</li>

Therefore, using that key to install from one Cloudify Manager and uninstall from another (after failover) will fail.<br /><strong>Workaround:</strong><br />Copy the private key to the Cloudify Manager that is becoming activate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>REST API</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloudifysource.atlassian.net/browse/CFY-6660">CFY-6660</a> - If you make a REST API call using the _include=created_by argument, you will receive a corrupted response.</li>
