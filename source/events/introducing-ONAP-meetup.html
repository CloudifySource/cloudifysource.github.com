					<p>Over the past few years, open source has emerged as a catalyst for change in the telecommunications and cable industry. As large-scale open source platforms beginning with the OpenDaylight project, continue to gain momentum, telecommunications play an increasingly important role in the open source communities, and are beginning to evolve the open source methodology to address the needs of the world's largest operators and their technology partners.</p>

					<p>This event will present Linux Foundation best practices and experience driving among the most important open source projects in telecommunications. As open source migrates up the stack, we will present examples based on the OPEN-O open orchestration project, which is in the process of merging into the Open Network Automation Platform (ONAP), along with open source ECOMP.</p>
					</ul>

					<p>Please register for the <strong>VIP Cocktail Party</strong> following the event. Confirmation will be received from the Cloudify team.</p>
