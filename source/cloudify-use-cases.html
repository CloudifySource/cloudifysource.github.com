					<p></p>
					<p>The company is one of the largest reinsurance companies in the world and offers a wide range of primary and health insurance products to businesses and private individuals as well as asset management. 
					<ul>
					<li>A publicly traded company currently has over 40,000 employees around the world</li>
					<li>Revenue of over $50 billion over its 4 business units</li>	
					</ul>
					</p>
					<h3><strong>Challenge:</strong></h3>
					<p>This tier-1 reinsurance company has big data computational requirements for actuarial calculations which are performed against a diversity of databases constantly.  These databases run on nearly 600 OpenStack VMs, and need to continually be managed, monitored, and upgraded all while enabling continuous integration and development in testing and production environments.</p>   

					<h3><strong>Solution:</strong></h3>
					<p>Cloudify enabled this company to deploy databases on demand, manage them, upgrade them as needed through a simple application blueprint while tying all of the pieces of the infrastructure and application together.  The complex architecture contains a management portal to request environment provisioning, an existing IaaS orchestrator that sends JSON requests to Cloudify, a DNS/DHCP that receives the IPs, OpenStack cloud, NetApp storage, Chef for application deployment, alongside 6+ backup and monitoring tools. </p>

					<div class="pullquote-bottom"><h1><strong>Tier-1 North American Bank (Production)</strong></h1></div>
					<p></p>

					<p>The client is one of the largest banks in North America, and the world (based market capitalization)</p>
					<ul>
					<li>With about 90 billion USD in assets</li>
					<li>Over 85,000 employees</li>
					<li>Over 25 million clients worldwide</li>
					<li>With more than 2,300 branches across North America</li>
					<li>Providing hundreds of services under three main business lines, two retail and one wholesale banking. </li>
					<li>Their services include digital banking, lending, investing, asset management, insurance, and more.</li>
					</ul>					
					
					<h3><strong>Challenge:</strong></h3>
					<p>The organization was facing challenges with accumulating too much technology, in business siloes, that was not standardized and was fragmented across business units.  The need to create a single source for their diversity of technology, along with a deployment model that was easily consumable yet scalable, by developers and operations alike across hybrid stacks and infrastructure.

					<h3><strong>Solution:</strong></h3>
					<p>The Cloudify team helped the banks’s team build a standardized selection of “certified” blueprints, that the client would be able to provide their 10+ lines of business (LOBs), in a simple web-based catalog for one-click consumption. This catalog gave the bank’s developers a simple method to configure and provision environments on demand to test their hundreds of applications and rollout new services, without the former time-consuming procurement cycles, or bottleneck of IT provisioning. Since the blueprints are written in simple YAML, developers were also able to modify and customize the blueprints to match the configuration needed for each particular environment, enabling level of flexibility a human operator would be able to provide.</p>

					<p>The work of the Cloudify team enabled technology standardization across the entire business and all LOBs, in a multinational corporation, ultimately <strong>lowering the bank’s costs <em>by 40%</em></strong>, enabling them to <strong>deploy over 5000 nodes</strong> on OpenStack in production, helped them <strong>introduce over 50 new digital services</strong> and technologies to their internal end-users and clientele, and <strong>seven new platforms</strong>, all in <em>under one year</em>.</p>

					<div class="pullquote-bottom"><h1><strong>A Leading International Maritime Satellite Company - (PoC)</strong></h1></div>
					<p></p>

					<p>The company is one of the largest mobile satellite communications network companies in the world, offering communications services whether in air, on land, or at sea.</p>

					<h3><strong>Challenge:</strong></h3>
					<p>The challenge for this global company is to describe, provision and orchestrate network services in the format of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) and Service Chain Functions (SFCs), at global scale and with multi-tenancy, by utilizing SDN/NFV and virtualization technologies.</p>

					<h3><strong>Solution:</strong></h3>
					<p><strong>Cloudify Service Function Chaining Capabilities Using Basic OpenStack Design</strong></p>
					<p>The initial stage of this use case was to define a Cloudify blueprint of a service chain of 3 VNFs as well as on-boarding and instantiation of a new SFC on OpenStack.</p>

					<p><strong>Underlay Network Orchestration and Provisioning</strong></p>
					<p>The next project was to define the services that can drive the underlay definition in order to understand the role that Cloudify plays, as a stand-alone solution or as an Orchestrator, of an SDN Controller (Open Daylight or Contrail).</p>

					<p><strong>Cloudify’s Use of Container Technology for SFC</strong></p>
					<p>The client wanted to evaluate Cloudify’s ability to instantiate a VNF on containers as well as a Service Function Chain using containers and non-containerized functions, such as VMs or hardware-based services in a hybrid environment.</p>

					<p><strong>Cloudify Support for Distributed SFCs</strong></p>
					<p>With Cloudify’s capabilities to instantiate SFCs proven, the next phase entailed Service Function Chaining that spans across DC’s and SAS locations around the world.</p>

					<p><strong>Deployment and Management of Nominum DNS on OpenStack in Locations Throughout Europe</strong></p>
					<h3><strong>Challenge:</strong></h3>
					<p>To build a DNS service with orchestration that can effectively and dynamically manage the lifecycle of a set of highly scalable, fault tolerant, virtualized network services residing in a distributed but interconnected cloud platform.</p>

					<h3><strong>Solution:</strong></h3>
					<p>Cloudify provided full, end-to-end automation and orchestration of Nominum DNS, with IPv6 support, at a number of datacenters located throughout Europe. This service is a highly complex, distributed VNF utilizing an IPv6 stack, and something that Cloudify is uniquely suited to handle. The Cloudify team created a TOSCA blueprint describing the topology of OpenStack and the application, which was to be used by the developers to deploy Nominum DNS on each of the datacenters. Cloudify would also be used to manage the state of the service on each datacenter as well as any other lifecycle operation. As a result of this work, the team built a generic architecture that Cloudify can use to deploy any network service on any datacenter.</p>
