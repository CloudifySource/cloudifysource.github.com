						<h1><strong>Introducing Pure-Play Orchestration for <ANY TECHNOLOGY></strong></h1>
						<h2>Full Application Lifecycle Orchestration with Cloudify</h2>
						<p>With the diversity of technology application stacks, tooling and infrastructure - mixing and matching what works for your business, developers and team can become a daunting task.</p>
						<p> What if we told you that you can choose your stack, your tooling, run it on any infrastructure - even hybrid environments easily?  Zero-config easily.</p>
						 <p>Cloudify, based on TOSCA (Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications), is technology agnostic enabling you to orchestrate your entire application lifecycle by modeling your topology once, and then deploying to your infrastructure of choice, and then managing, monitoring, scaling and healing all in the same place.</p>
						 <p>What's more, with Cloudify's out-of-the-box integrations with leading clouds, infrastructure, and tooling (seriously - from OpenStack to VMware to Docker using Chef, Puppet or even SSH with Fabric) - you can literally just download and get started.</p>
						 <h3><strong>It's as easy as >> MODEL >> DEPLOY >> MANAGE.</strong></h3>

					<h1><strong>Pure-play orchestration</strong> of applications on the cloud.</h1>
					<p>Most automation  tools are focused on the installation and configuration phases of application management, while in reality much of the management takes place after the application has been deployed.</p>
					<p>Cloudify was redesigned to eliminate the boundaries between orchestration and monitoring, providing a mechanism to automatically react to monitored events with the appropriate corrective measures. The building blocks of custom workflows, through a workflow engine, and the TOSCA modeling language enable the automation of any process and any stack, including monitoring and custom policies for automated triggering of such corrective measures to provide auto-healing and auto-scaling capabilities.</p>

					<h3><strong>Cloudify Improves App Agility for Enterprise Users</strong></h3>
					<p>Many enterprises these days suffer from heterogeneous internal IT infrastructures which include legacy systems coupled with latest technologies and tool chains, many times in business siloes - hindering agility significantly. Managing such diverse technologies can be problematic for alignment, versioning, maintainability and a significant drain on resources and productivity - not to mention competitiveness. </p>
					<p>Providing greater agility for Cloudify users by improving time to market for new software products is a primary goal for us. Enterprises need a single orchestration platform that spans diverse cloud infrastructure from OpenStack to VMware or even AWS in one solution, supporting different applications across multiple lines of business. </p>
					<p>Cloudify solves these problems by offering pure-play orchestration that is infrastructure and tool agnostic - enabling easy pluggability and portability of infrastructure and integration of any tool set, essentially providing a framework for deploying a wide range of tools across the entire stack, including logging, monitoring and policy management.</p>

								<p>Cloudify is OpenStack native, this means it was built to work seamlessly with OpenStack deployments of all kinds enabling you to orchestrate your apps easily for any use case: hybrid cloud, NFV, simplified migration, or hybrid workload environments (bare metal, containers and more).</p>
								<p> As part of the native approach, Cloudify is deeply integrated with leading OpenStack projects:</p>

								<p>Through the VMware-Cloudify integration, users now have a framework for automating the installation, deployment and post-deployment processes (such as monitoring, self-healing, auto-scaling and continuous delivery) of applications in a consistent manner across the VMware stack using a standards-based deployment (TOSCA). VMware users can also use Cloudify to extend their VMware environment into other clouds - including <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/openstack-architecture-cloudify.html">OpenStack</a>, to form a true hybrid cloud, as well as for pure-play <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/network-function-virtualization-vnf-nfv-orchestration-sdn-platform.html">NFV orchestration.</p>

								<h3><strong>Native Integration with OpenStack</strong></h3>
								<p>As OpenStack is fast becoming the defacto standard for private clouds, Cloudify 3 was redesigned for even tighter integration with OpenStack technology and core services, including KeyStone, Neutron, Nova and Heat. The underlying design of Cloudify was also re-architected to match the design principles of OpenStack services, including the rewriting of the core services in Python and leveraging common infrastructure building blocks such as RabbitMQ.</p>

								<h3><strong>TOSCA Support</strong></h3>
								<p><a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=tosca" target="_blank">TOSCA (Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications)</a> is a specification that allows users  to describe any set of automation processes on cloud applications with an extensible  set of hooks and component types. Cloudify 3 uses a YAML-based orchestration template driven by the TOSCA specification. The next release of Cloudify will include full syntax compatibility with the TOSCA specification as soon as it becomes officially supported.</p>

								<h4><strong>Multiple applications that can span thousands of nodes</strong></h4>
								<p>Managing and monitoring of an application requires tight integration with the application to enable quick failure-detection, scaling and other reactive actions. As this makes orchestration tasks heavier, many existing orchestration tools are limited by their monitoring and orchestration engine. This is particularly challenging with big data or networking services that can span to thousands of instances for a single deployment.</p>
								<p>Cloudify 3 provides management and monitoring of large scale applications using a message broker, such as RabbitMQ, to manage the communication with its managed instances and a logging and analysis engine, through logstash and Elasticsearch, for big data scale.</p>

							<h4><strong>New Topology-Driven Monitoring</strong></h4>
								<p>Many existing monitoring tools were designed to monitor applications only after they have been deployed. In a DevOps environment in which the application continuously changes, sometimes hundreds of times each day, keeping the monitoring system in sync with the actual application deployment is a challenge. As the monitoring systems are often not equipped to map the application topology and architecture, complex and error-prone discovery models are needed to map the application deployment and the dependencies of its components.</p>
								<p>Cloudify 3 introduces a new concept of topology-driven monitoring in which the entire application management and tracking system is centralized around the application topology, rather than the infrastructure. This makes it possible, at any given moment, to track not only the state of the application, but also the status of deployment, updates, and scaling processes through a single view. As the monitoring system is integrated with the orchestration engine, the two systems are always in sync and up to date, eliminating the need to rely on external discovery services.</p>
