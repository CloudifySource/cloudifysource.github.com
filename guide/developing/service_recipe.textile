A service recipe is comprised of the service descriptor file and its supporting files.

h2. Service Descriptor File

The service descriptor file describes the following information:
* "General":#general: The service name, service type, number of service instances, and the service icon filename
* Compute: Hardware and software requirements
* "Lifecycle events":/guide/developing/lifecycle_events: Maps events to handling scripts or closures and, as such, is the most important part of the service recipe
* "Custom commands":/guide/developing/custom_commands: Maps custom commands to handling scripts that can be invoked as commands using the Cloudify shell
* "Plugins":/guide/developing/plugins: Liveness and Monitoring plugins
* "UI layout":/guide/developing/configuring_ui_section: Describes the layout to use for displaying the collected metrics in the "Cloudify web management console":/guide/monitoring/the_web_management_console
<h4 class="info">In future releases, Cloudify will also support "*provided services*". These services are not provisioned by Cloudify and are only monitored for availability.</h4>

h3(#general). General Section

The *General* section describes the following attributes:

|_. Attributes |_. Description |
| @name@ | The service name is used to identify this service by the various Cloudify management and monitoring tools. Therefore, the name must be unique across all services that are managed by the same Cloudify controller. |
| @icon@ | The optional image file to use as an icon for this service in the *Application Map* that is displayed in the "Cloudify web management console":/guide/monitoring/the_web_management_console. |
| @type@ | The service type is used by the Cloudify web management console to determine the location of this service in the *Application Map*. If you do not specify an @icon@ in this section, the service type is used to determine the default icon to display in the *Application Map*. The following service types are supported:
<ul><li>WEB_SERVER</li>
<li>APP_SERVER</li>
<li>DATABASE</li>
<li>NOSQL_DB</li>
<li>MESSAGE_BUS</li>
<li>ESB_SERVER</li>
<li>SECURITY_SERVER</li></ul> |
| @numInstances@ | The initial number of instances provisioned when this service is started. |

The following shows an example of the *General* section.
