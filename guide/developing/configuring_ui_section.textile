p. Cloudify recipes allow the recipe developer to specify the UI layout for metrics collected by Cloudify (built-in or custom).

h1. Customizable Parts of the Cloudify Web Based UI

The Cloudify UI display custom metrics using the Line-Bar Chart and the Balance Gauge (Additional widgets will be added in future versions).
Each widget displays a default metric but has a drop-down menu to allow the user to choose other metrics

The images below show the GUI widgets and the Metrics drop down menu:

h1. Built-In and Custom Metrics

By default, Cloudify monitors generic metrics such as CPU and memory utilization. But it can also monitor any other, more specific metric using one of two mechanisms: "Monitoring Probes":/guide/developing/probes, which are simply groovy closures that emit metrics and their current values, or "custom monitoring plugins":/guide/plugins_and_probes/develop_your_plugin, which are Java classes that do the same.
In both cases, Cloudify invokes the probe or plugin every 5 seconds, and expects to get a Map that contains the metrics names as keys and their respective values. Both the built in and custom metrics are visualized by the web based user interface, and the recipe has a dedicated section which controls how they are visualized.

h1. Configuring the Metrics Menus

The Applications view in the web based UI contains a dedicated metric pane that visualizes the monitored metrics and allows to choose between the monitored metrics using dedicated drop down menus. The metric menus are divided into logical groups of metrics. The recipe allows you to configure these groups and determine which metrics (built in as well as custom) will belong to each menu. Here's an example for how this is done:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1766801.js?file=ui_config.groovy"></script>

In the above recipe snippet, we have ...

h1. Configuring the Metrics Pane

You can also control the appearance and default metrics that will appear in the metrics pane for each service. You can determine how many widgets will show up in the Metrics section of the UI, and what will be the metric presented by default for each widget.

h1. Built-In Recipes as an Example

The best way to start with metrics configuraiton is to look at one of the built in examples, e.g. the PetClinic recipe under &lt;Cloudify installation root&gt;/examples/petclinic. The tomcat recipe (&lt;Cloudify installation root&gt;/examples/petclinic/tomcat/tomcat-service.groovy) uses a the JMX plugin, whereas the MongoDB recipes (e.g. &lt;Cloudify installation root&gt;/examples/petclinic/mongod) use a "custom plugin":/guide/plugins_and_probes/develop_your_plugin that connects to MongoDB using its Java API and fetches metrics using specific MongoDB API commands.
