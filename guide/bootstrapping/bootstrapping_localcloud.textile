A local cloud is a full-fledged cloud emulation environment that allows the user to run all Cloudify management and application services on a single machine.

h2. Prerequisites

Before you bootstrp your local cloud, make sure that your environment meets all the minimum requirements. For more information, see the "Prerequisites":/guide/bootstrapping/bootstrapping_process#prereqs section of the Bootstrapping Process topic.

h2. Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping the Local Cloud is extremely simple, just follow steps 1 & 2 of the "bootstrapping":/guide/bootstrapping/bootstrapping_process#boot section in the Bootstrapping Process topic, typing the following command: @bootstrap-localcloud@

h4(warn). If you exit the shell, the local cloud is not teared down and it will continue running until your explicitly "teardown" the local cloud:#tear. If this happens, to teardown the cloud, start the Cloudify shell, and then at the prompt, type @connect localhost@ to connect. This will reconnect the shell to the local cloud environment.

h2(#tear). Teardown

To shut down the local cloud environment, at the Cloudify shell prompt, type: *@teardown-localcloud@*

h4(info). This uninstalls application, and shuts down all local cloud processes running on your machine.
