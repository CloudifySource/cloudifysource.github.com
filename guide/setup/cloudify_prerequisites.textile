* @%JAVA_HOME%\bin@ must be added to the beginning of the @PATH@ environment variable. For example, @%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%SystemRoot%\System32;%SystemRoot%;@.

h2. Prerequisites for Cloud Images that are used by Cloudify

When installing applications on the cloud, Cloudify provisions VMs using cloud images. These cloud images must meet the following minimum requirements:
* JDK 1.6 or higher must be installed in the image.
* The SSH daemon must be started and running port 22.

h3. Networking and Ports on the Cloud

In order for Cloudify to operate correctly, your environment must meet the following networking requirements:
* Within the security group to which the started images belong, all ports must be open for bidirectional communication from private IP addresses.
* On the management VMs, ports 8099 and 8100 must be open for communication from the Internet via the VMs' public IP address. This allows the Cloudify shell to interact with the REST server and allows users to access the management web application.
