h2. Setting the shell window buffer size (on Windows)

The shell has a known issue of getting stuck when reaching the row limit of characters. Therefore, we advise you to configure the command window buffer size and window size for the Cloudify shell.

# Right click the title bar of the command window.
# Choose the Properties option.
# Select the Layout tab (3rd tab from from left).
# Modify the width and height of the Screen buffer and of the Window and then press OK.
